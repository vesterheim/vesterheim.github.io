Artist Kari Steihaug, from Oslo, Norway, will give a free presentation about her work on Saturday, April 16, at 7:00 p.m. at Vesterheim's Amdal-Odland Heritage Center. 

Knitting is no longer just a functional and rural handcraft. Because Norwegian sweaters and their patterns are so recognizable, artists in Norway, and globally, have used them in different ways.  

Kari has done a wide variety of works featuring knitting. She has used knitting to help bring nature and warmth into an office space of glass and metal. She also partially unravels knit items and reknits the yarn into a tapestry. Kari says that she likes the wavy traces of the stitches. She sees them as a personal handwriting embedded in the yarn that isn’t easily washed away.   

Kari explained about her work in a 2011 interview, “[Found objects] was the theme that functioned as my doorway to knitting. I was working a lot with time and vanity and human presence. And at some point I became interested in clothes and textiles as the membrane between the body and the world. Protection and vulnerability are important aspects of my work. It became natural to explore textiles closely associated with lived lives.” 

The presentation is in conjunction with the exhibition, _From Underwear to Everywhere: Norwegian Sweaters,_ on view through April 24. The exhibition and lecture are sponsored by Sallie and Darrell DeReus, Carol and Darold Johnson, and Blue Heron Knittery with additional support from Ruth Hinderaker, Oneota Weavers Guild in memory of Betty Rikansrud Nelson, Susan and David Willig, Glenn and Arnhild Hillesland, and Gerald and Mary A. Paulson.
