Vesterheim invites everyone to meet our new President/CEO, Chris Johnson, at a reception in the museum’s Bruening Visitor Center from 5:00 until 7:00 p.m. on Thursday, June 18. Informal refreshments will be served and admission to the museum will be free all day in his honor.

“We want the community to meet our new leader and to celebrate his arrival at this informal event,” Kate Martinson, Vesterheim’s Board Chair, said. 

“Chris Johnson's arrival marks a new chapter in the story of Vesterheim’s growth and service as a quality museum. He brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to his new position, as well as a lively personality and wide interests,” Martinson added. 

The Vesterheim position represents a meaningful homecoming for Chris Johnson. A native of Northeast Iowa, he graduated from Luther College in 1987 with a B.A. in history, and he says that Vesterheim and the area around Decorah are places he has valued all his life. He did his graduate work at the University of Nebraska and an internship with Vesterheim in 1997, the same year he received his Masters in Museum Studies.

Since that time, Chris Johnson has worked for the State Historical Society of North Dakota, first as its Regional Historic Sites Manager from 1998 to 2007, and then as its Museum Division Director from 2007 to the present. 

Johnson was an integral part of a major expansion at the State Historical Society of North Dakota. He says he sees Vesterheim poised now for the same kind of dynamic growth and believes his experience with the North Dakota expansion will allow him to skillfully guide Vesterheim’s future development.
