Vesterheim welcomes Jørgen Sando from Telemark, Norway, who will give a presentation on Sunday, September 27, at 2:00 p.m., in the museum’s Amdal-Odland Heritage Center. The presentation is free and open to the public.

Jørgen Sando is a fourth-generation goldsmith in Telemark and specializes in “bunad silver,” which are brooches and other jewelry items for Norwegian national costumes.

He will talk about the rich traditions and symbolism surrounding silver jewelry in rural Norway, how the jewelry has been used on folk costumes, and how to choose the right silver for your bunad. 

You are invited to bring a piece of old Norwegian jewelry for identification. Sando is excited to share with audiences the mysteries and forgotten, ancient language of bunad jewelry.  

“In Telemark, the traditions of working in silver were strong and never completely died out,”  Laurann Gilbertson, Vesterheim’s Chief Curator, said.
