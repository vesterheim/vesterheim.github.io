During National Volunteer Week, April 12-18, Vesterheim joins organizations nationwide in celebrating the contributions of volunteers. All current and prospective volunteers are invited to an Open House on Thursday, April 16, from 2:00-4:00 p.m. at Vesterheim’s Bruening Visitor Center, 520 W. Water Street. Refreshments will be served, and information about volunteer opportunities will be available.  

Vesterheim volunteers serve as tour guides and folk-art demonstrators, cooks and servers, clerical and curatorial helpers, translators and teachers, carpenters and painters, and more. “Vesterheim is grateful for the contributions of time and talent provided by its volunteers,” says Martha Griesheimer, Coordinator of Volunteers. “Each volunteer brings a unique combination of skills and enthusiasm,” she continued, “and we look forward to thanking each of them at this event.”

In 2014, 293 volunteers worked 3,374 hours on behalf of the museum. According to The Independent Sector, which calculates the value of volunteer time, those hours are worth over $70,000.  

Volunteer opportunities for people from many walks of life are available at Vesterheim. The Open House will feature a slide show of volunteers in action throughout the past year. “The time commitment to volunteer varies from hundreds of hours per year, to just a few hours occasionally,” according to Griesheimer. She says “the best part of my job is working with volunteers to match them with tasks they will enjoy.”

Vesterheim has many volunteers, but can always benefit from the involvement of new ones. “A consistent pool of volunteers is necessary for the museum to provide programming for area schoolchildren, staffing events, and to assist daily visitors,” says Griesheimer. “Every volunteer needs to be able to say ‘no’ at times, so there are never too many on the list,” she explains.

Prospective volunteers will be able to sign up at the Open House. Information is also available on Vesterheim’s website: http://vesterheim.org/join-give/volunteer/, or by emailing [Martha Griesheimer](mailto:mgriesheimer@vesterheim.org), coordinator of volunteers.
