This display honors the signing of this important document. It features commemorative artifacts from Vesterheim’s collection and a model of the Eidsvoll building where the constitution was signed on May 17, 1814. The display also discusses political and cultural developments in Norway in the ensuing years. It was guest curated by intern Mary Claire Vuckovich.

_Alt for Norge_ includes memories of _Syttende Mai_ celebrations in Decorah.
