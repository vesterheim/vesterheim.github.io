Visit Vesterheim for two free presentations on June 10, 2016. 

7:00-7:45 p.m. - _Textiles and the Warp Weighted Loom—From the Bronze Age to the Present_ by Elizabeth Johnston. 

8:00-8:45 p.m. - _Storytelling, The Gift of Sheep, Wool, and Spinning_ by Martha Owen.

Martha and Elizabeth will team teach classes this summer at Vesterheim's Folk Art School. During their stay they invite everyone to learn more about spinning and weaving at these two presentations.

Elizabeth Johnston, Sheltano, United Kingdom, is a Shetland spinner and knitter. She learned much of her craft as a child, observing and receiving lessons from family and friends. She uses these age-old skills, handed down through generations, to turn Shetland fleece into beautiful soft yarns and Fair Isle and lace items for her business, Shetland Handspun. Interest in the long history of Shetland textiles led to research into historic fabrics and the warp-weighted loom. She is author of two chapters in Shetland Textiles 800 BC to the Present, edited by S.Laurenson. Elizabeth has demonstrated, lectured, and taught workshops in spinning, lace, and Fair Isle knitting throughout Europe and the United States.

Martha Owen is a resident artist in spinning, knitting, feltmaking, and dyeing at the John C. Campbell Folkschool in Brasstown, North Carolina. Her adventure in spinning began at the school in 1978. Since then her extended family has included sheep (Corriedale, Shetland, Romney) and Angora rabbits (French).  As a banjo player and storyteller, Martha’s interest in sheep and wool, music, and dance has carried her literally and joyfully around the world. She is a member of the Southern Highland Craft Guild and is co-owner of Yarn Circle in Murphy, North Carolina.
