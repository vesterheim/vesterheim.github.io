Meet Heather Torgenrud, who will sign her new book _Norwegian Pick-Up Bandweaving_, on September 19 from 4:30-5:00 p.m. in Vesterheim's Museum Store. 

For the first time in English, here's a complete book about Norwegian pick-up bandweavingâ€”from its fascinating history to beautiful bands you can make yourself, with more than 100 pattern charts from bands in museum collections. The book is richly illustrated with artifacts from Vesterheim's collection. 

Meticulously researched, easy-to-read, and profusely illustrated, this book is destined to become a classic in the field. It will interest not only weavers but anyone who appreciates textile arts, folk costumes, and Norwegian culture.

Heather Torgenrud of Arlee, Montana, has been weaving for over 40 years and enjoys teaching bandweaving classes around the country. She first dreamed of writing a book when the gift of an inkle loom sparked not only a passion for weaving pick-up bands but a longing to know their history. The dream finally took shape when she and her husband were immersed in studying Norwegian and she discovered some intriguing stories waiting to be told. With the book, she brings together award-winning weaving skills with her easy, readable writing style, to create a well-researched and fascinating look at this historic craft.
