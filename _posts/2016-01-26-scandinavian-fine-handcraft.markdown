  teaser: "Be inspired by budding folk artists who are studying Norwegian handcrafts and Scandinavian traditions with woodcarver Harley Refsal."

Be inspired by budding folk artists and Scandinavian traditions at Vesterheim Museum. Students from Harley Refsal's "Scandinavian Fine Handcraft" January-term course at Luther College will demonstrate carving and exhibit their class projects at Vesterheim on Tuesday, January 26, from 4:30-6:30 p.m. 

Everyone is invited to this free event. Refreshments will be served, including s’mores in the museum’s courtyard (weather permitting). 

At 5:30 p.m., Harley will give a short gallery talk in the exhibition _Woodcarved Figures, Nordic Roots,_ which showcases some of the best examples of historic and contemporary Scandinavian flat-plane carving. The exhibition is sponsored by Owen and Naomi Bekkum.

Harley Refsal is a Vesterheim Gold Medalist who has taught Scandinavian figure carving throughout the United States and Norway. He was honored by H. M. Harald V, King of Norway, with the St. Olav Medal of Honor for his efforts in reinvigorating Scandinavian figure carving in both the United States and Norway. He is the author of several books and was named the 2012 Woodcarver of the Year by the magazine *Wood Carving Illustrated*.
