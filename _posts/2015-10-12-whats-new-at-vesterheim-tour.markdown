Everyone is invited to a “What’s New at Vesterheim?” tour on October 12 at 1:30 p.m. The tour will begin in the museum’s Main Building and is open to the public free of charge.

“This tour highlights the special exhibitions that are on view for several months and many recent improvements in the museum's permanent exhibits, including a newly-installed music display,” says Martha Griesheimer, Coordinator of Volunteers. 
  
The tour is part of Fall Guide Training for the volunteers who provide tours for Vesterheim's visitors year-round. For more information on this volunteer opportunity at Vesterheim, and the full guide training schedule, email [Martha Griesheimer](mailto:mgriesheimer@vesterheim.org), or call 563-382-9681 ext. 305.
