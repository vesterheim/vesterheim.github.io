Everyone is invited to a storage facility tour, “Vesterheim’s Deep Collections,” on October 13 at 1:30 p.m. The tour will begin at the Bruening Visitor Center at 502 W. Water Street and is open to the public free of charge.

This glimpse of behind-the-scenes storage areas is a rare opportunity to experience the depth and breadth of Vesterheim's collections. Advanced registration for the tour is appreciated. Email [Martha Griesheimer](mailto:mgriesheimer@vesterheim.org), or call 563-382-9681 ext. 305 by Monday, October 12. 
  
“Only a small percentage of Vesterheim's collections are on view in the public exhibit areas. The thousands of objects in storage are a valuable resource for researchers and Vesterheim's folk art classes,” said Laurann Gilbertson, Vesterheim’s Chief Curator.
  
The tour is part of Fall Guide Training for the volunteers who provide tours for Vesterheim's visitors year-round. For more information on this volunteer opportunity at Vesterheim, and the full guide training schedule, email [Martha Griesheimer](mailto:mgriesheimer@vesterheim.org), or call 563-382-9681 ext. 305.
