This year’s auction will be completely online. Preview auction items [here](https://www.biddingforgood.com/auction/auctionhome.action?vhost=VEST-2014).

You can bid from anywhere in the world! The auction will go live at noon on Oct. 1 and bidding will end at 9:00 p.m. on Oct. 29 (CST).

These one-of-a-kind folk-art pieces of rosemaling, woodworking, fiber arts, and more are by the best artists working in the Norwegian tradition and will be available only in Vesterheim’s Folk Art Benefit Auction.

Make sure to view the valuable collectors pieces from legendary rosemaling painters Sigmund Aarseth, Addie Pittelkow, Ethel Kvalheim, and Gyda Mahlum. There are also pieces by Norwegian rosemaling instructors Gunnar Bø, Turid Helle Fatland, and Bergljot Lunde.

Additional artwork is by Vesterheim’s Gold Medalists and other talented artists, including unforgettable rosemaling, Hardanger embroidery, beautiful weavings, acanthus carving, figure carving, woodturning, baskets, and a fantastic handmade knife. What a wonderful way to start, or add to, your very own folk art collection and support Vesterheim Museum at the same time. Vesterheim is very grateful to all of these artists, who have donated their work to this auction.

The auction is only available online and you can bid from anywhere in the world. It is one of our biggest fundraising events and we are excited to share it. All proceeds go to projects directly related to Vesterheim’s Folk Art School. Please help support Vesterheim Museum, so that we can help keep these wonderful Norwegian folk-art traditions alive.
