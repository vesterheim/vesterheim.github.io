Come to Vesterheim's Norwegian Christmas Celebration on December 5 and meet Stine Aasland, “Norway’s Waffle Queen” from Telemark, Norway, who will make and sell waffles and sign her new book _We Love Waffles_ from 10 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. in the Bruening Visitor Center.

Scandinavian waffle culture is much more than just eating a waffle now and then. Waffles are the ultimate comfort food, a symbol of love, appropriate for something shaped like a heart. 

In Stine's book you will find basic recipes for Norwegian, Swedish, multigrain, and gluten-free waffles. You will also find recipes for everyday waffles, party waffles, and dessert waffles. Stine will inspire you to make your own waffles and enjoy new flavor experiences as well as a little taste of Scandinavia. 

Stine founded Telemarksrøra in 2008, which today is Norway’s largest waffle company.  In 2014, she sold the company and moved to the United States, where she now has established Norsk Vaffel LLC (Norwegian Waffle). 

Her goal is to spread Scandinavian waffles all over the United States!
