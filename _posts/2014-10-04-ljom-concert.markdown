From 7:00-9:00 p.m., free show in the Hotel Winneshiek Lobby with full menu and bar available. Nordic Roots music—traditional Norwegian mountain melodies with influences of jazz, rock, classical, contemporary, and world music.

These specific melodies are from a small mountain town called Snåsa, Norway, where band members Kjersti, Anne Marte, and Sivert grew up. Together with a pianist from Frosta and a guitarist from Sweden, these young musicians have formed Ljom, a unique group with a vast musical background. Some of the members have studied jazz, rock and world music, while others have emerged themselves in classical and contemporary. The mix is new and exciting, with a collective point of focus on the Norwegian traditional mountain melodies, also called Kauk. Everyone in the group composes and arranges the songs. Their first album will be released in June 2014 on the label Kirkelig Kulturverksted.

According to the website of Northside, a Minneapolis-based music label, Nordic Roots is "the most exciting music movement on the planet." Northside says, "Scores of young musicians from Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Samiland are taking the music and instruments of their ancestors and bringing new ideas, arrangements, influences, and instrumentation to an often lost art."
