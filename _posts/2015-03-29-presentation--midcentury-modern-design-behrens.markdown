Roy Behrens, Professor of Art and Distinguished Scholar at the University of Northern Iowa, will give the presentation _Less is More, More or Less: The Roots of Mid-Century Modern Design_ at Vesterheim on Sunday, March 29, at 2:00 p.m. in the museum’s Amdal-Odland Heritage Center. This free presentation is offered in conjunction with Vesterheim’s exhibition, _Scandinavian Modern Design: Norwegian Enamel,_ on view through April 19, 2015. 

This presentation is a fast-paced illustrated look at some of the ideas, events, and developments that combined to nudge twentieth-century designers toward the prevailing belief that “less is more.” The subject range of Behrens’s presentation includes design in the broadest sense (architectural, graphic, industrial, interior), with elegant visual examples from the United States, the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, and other parts of Europe.

Behrens says, “Looking back on design in the nineteenth century, it is almost always said that the Victorian era was typified by an insatiable indulgence in excessive ornamentation, a belief perhaps that ‘more is more.’ Amazingly, much of that radically evolved, both prior to and during the first half of the twentieth century, as design became infused by trends that are commonly known as ‘Modern’ today.” 

Behrens has taught graphic design and design history for 44 years at American colleges and universities. He has published seven books, hundreds of journal and magazine articles, and has been featured in interviews on NOVA, National Public Radio, Australian Public Radio, and BBC, as well as in documentary films. He is internationally known for his extensive research and writings about modern camouflage in relation to art and design.
