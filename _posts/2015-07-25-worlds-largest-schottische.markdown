Join the World’s Largest Schottische on July 25, 2015, at 8:50 p.m.! This special event is in cooperation with the local Scandianvian-American dance band, Foot-Notes, during Decorah's Nordic Fest Celebration. 

Everyone is welcome to register and be counted to make this the world's largest schottische—that is, the most people dancing the schottische at one time. 

Register each person participating at Eventbrite [here](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/worlds-largest-schottische-registration-16965249518?aff=ehomecard), or in person at the event. Everyone registered will receive a special wrist band to be included in the count.

The street dance begins on the east end of Decorah's business district on Water Street at 7:30 p.m. giving everyone a chance to brush up on the schottische steps, as well as the polka, waltz, and two step. 
The schottische count will take place at exactly 8:50 p.m. and will only last a few minutes. Don't be late! 

This event is in celebration of Foot-Notes' 25th Anniversary. The band formed in 1991 to carry on a tradition of monthly old-time dances in a rustic two-room schoolhouse in Highlandville, Iowa, where residents have been gathering for years. Their dances also have been a popular part of Nordic Fest. Learn more about Foot-Notes [here](http://www.footnotes.dance/index.htm).
