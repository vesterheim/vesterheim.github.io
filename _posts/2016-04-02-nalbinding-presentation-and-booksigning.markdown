Saturday, April 2

Long-time fiber artist and workshop leader, Donna Kallner, is coming to Vesterheim on April 2 for a book signing and a free presentation. 
  
The presentation _New Age Looping_ will be in the musem’s Amdal-Odland Heritage Center at 1:30 p.m. During this presentation, Kallner will discuss the living traditions of indigenous people and the art and craft of contemporary looping. Knitting, netting, and nålbinding are all loop techniques. Looping is a living legacy from the Stone Age until today, with each age and place using the techniques differently. Kallner will show artifacts from six continents and samples of a vast array of possibilities created with variations on this family of techniques. This presentation is sponsored in part by the Grace Rikansrud Memorial Lecture Fund.

The book signing will be from 11:30 a.m. -12:30 p.m. in the Museum Store. Kallner will be joined by fellow fiber artists Sue Flanders and Janine Kosel from the Twin Cities area. Kallner will sign her book _New Age Looping, Skipped Stitch Patterns._ Flanders and Kosel will sign their book _Swedish Handknits: A Collection of Heirloom Designs._

Kallner, from rural northern Wisconsin, fuses ancient skills with modern materials. Her deep research, collecting and personal work involve artistic expression with natural dyes, functional objects, and techniques known over time and world-wide. She is also known to the Decorah community through an annual willow gathering at Willowglen, the farm and studio of area gardeners Lee Zieke and Lindsay Lee.
