This facinacting talk by Kari Gronningsaeter and Nick Preus will be on May 19 at 6:30 p.m. in the museum's Bethania Church on Mill Street. 

Hear the tale of this voyage around the world in 1913-1914, based on the letters and journals of Gronningsæter’s grandmother. The ship, a full rigger captained by Gronningsæter’s great-grandfather, sailed to Australia loaded with timber and returned to Norway loaded with wheat. On the way home, in the Atlantic, they found out that WWI had started.
