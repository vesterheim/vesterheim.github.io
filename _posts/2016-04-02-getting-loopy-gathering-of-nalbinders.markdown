### What’s Next? Embellishing Your Nålbinding 

Explore ways to embellish your nålbinding project with a variety of techniques. Needle felting, embroidery and/or crochet are some of the wonderful ways to add color and texture to your completed piece. Bring a sample of fulled wool fabric to explore the possibilities of embellishment. Bring a needle felting needle, crochet hook (size to match your yarn), and/or a sharp big eye embroidery needle. We will have a variety of needle point yarn) and a sharp big-eye embroidery needle.

### New Age Looping Trunk Show

Nålbinding belongs to a large and diverse family of techniques called looping. This living legacy from the Stone Age continues to evolve as today's fiber artists give it their own spin. This session includes a lecture and Powerpoint program presenting artifacts from six of our seven continents, the living traditions of indigenous people, and the art and craft of contemporary looping. You'll also get a hands-on tour through a suitcase full of samples showing a vast array of possibilities created with variations on this family of techniques.

### ABCs of Teaching Simple Looping 

Simple looping is a great gateway to nålbinding. This session presents a model for teaching the technique to adults and children, plus 25 other elements of successful teaching and learning experiences, including learning styles, teaching progressions, gender influences on learning, and much more. 

### Cross-Knit Looping On The Edge

Nålbinders call it Coptic Stitch and jewelry makers call it Viking knitting. It's all the same structure though—cross-knit looping. This stitch variation has many uses, including reinforcing edges and joining panels of woven fabrics, felt, or knitting. In this session you'll learn how to completely enclose a seam or edge. This is portable handwork you can do in fragments of time with just a tapestry needle and yarn.
