Is the winter weather getting you down? New studies show that adult coloring is a great way to relieve stress, as well as create a more mindful and peaceful feeling. Also, coloring is linked to relieving symptoms of anxiety, depression, and even dementia. ”Coloring is a great distraction and uses different parts of your brain to focus, making stress disappear,” says Ashley Kluesner, Vesterheim Collections Intern.

Adults ages 18 and up are invited to a coloring event on February 23 from 7:00-8:30 p.m. at Vesterheim. This event is free and will be held in the Main Building in the special exhibition _From Tradition to Protest: Lila Nelson’s Weaving Life._ Come, relax, and learn about Lila's weavings while coloring pages based on her work. Refreshments, colored pencils, and coloring pages will be provided. “Lila's colorful weavings will offer lots of inspiration when coloring.” Laurann Gilbertson, Chief Curator. 

_From Tradition to Protest: Lila Nelson’s Weaving Life_ is on view through November 13, 2016. The exhibition includes 76 pieces from Vesterheim and private collections. Lila Nelson, Vesterheim’s first Textile Curator, was an accomplished textile artist. This retrospective exhibition shows how she began by mastering traditional Norwegian weaving techniques, subsequently using them in fresh and contemporary ways. Later in life she focused on tapestry weaving, which allowed her greater personal and political expression. 

The exhibition and coloring event are sponsored by Ella Ager Fossum, Jon and Mary Hart, Darold and Carol Oversvee Johnson, Steve and Barb Johnson, Kate Martinson, Irene Navarre, and Sonja Peterson.
