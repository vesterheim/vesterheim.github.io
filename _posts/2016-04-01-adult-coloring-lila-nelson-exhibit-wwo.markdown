Relax at Vesterheim during Decorah's Women's Weekenk Out! Adult coloring is the newest hot thing. It's a great way to relieve stress and bring peace. 

Stop by Vesterheim on April 1 between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m. to check out the weaving of Lila Nelson while coloring pages based on her work.

Lila Nelson, Vesterheim’s first Textile Curator, was an accomplished textile artist. _From Tradition to Protest: Lila Nelson’s Weaving Life_ is on view through November 13, 2016. The exhibition includes 76 pieces from Vesterheim and private collections. This retrospective exhibition shows how she began by mastering traditional Norwegian weaving techniques, subsequently using them in fresh and contemporary ways. Later in life she focused on tapestry weaving, which allowed her greater personal and political expression.
