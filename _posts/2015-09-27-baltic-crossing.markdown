Save the date! Baltic Crossing will play at Vesterheim on September 27, 2015. More details will be announced soon.

The band Baltic Crossing uses a strong affinity for old dance music and respect for each others' traditions to bring a new youthful energy to the folk music of Europe. 

With award-winning members hailing from the U.K., Finland, and Denmark, Baltic Crossing brings you fiery Scandinavian fiddles, bubbling Northumbrian pipes, and a driving guitar and double bass rhythm section. 

The band members are Ian Stephenson from the U.K. on guitar and button accordion; Andy May from the U.K. on Northumbrian bagpipes and piano; Esko Järvelä from Finland on five-stringed violin; Antti Järvelä from Finland on mandolin and double bass; and Kristian Bugge from Denmark on violin. Wherever they meet, at least one member must cross the Baltic Sea.
