Save the date! Baltic Crossing will play on September 27, 2015, at 7:00 p.m. in the museum’s Bethania Church on Mill Street. 

Tickets are $12 per person, available at the door. Contact Martha Griesheimer at 563-382-9681 or [mgriesheimer@vesterheim.org](mailto:mgriesheimer@vesterheim.org) for information about a workshop before the concert.

The band Baltic Crossing uses a strong affinity for old dance music and respect for each others' traditions to bring a new youthful energy to the folk music of Europe. 

With award-winning members hailing from the U.K., Finland, and Denmark, Baltic Crossing brings you fiery Scandinavian fiddles, bubbling Northumbrian pipes, and a driving guitar and double bass rhythm section. 

The band members are Ian Stephenson from the U.K. on guitar and button accordion; Andy May from the U.K. on Northumbrian bagpipes and piano; Esko Järvelä from Finland on five-stringed violin; Antti Järvelä from Finland on mandolin and double bass; and Kristian Bugge from Denmark on violin. Wherever they meet, at least one member must cross the Baltic Sea.
