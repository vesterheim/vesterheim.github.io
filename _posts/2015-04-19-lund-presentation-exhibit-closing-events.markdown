The exhibition closes on April 19 and there will be several museum activities to celebrate this popular show. 

Stop by the gallery in the museum’s Main Building between 1:00 and 2:00 p.m. to learn about the process of enameling (fusing powdered glass onto metal) with Norma Refsal and take a guided look at the exhibition with guest curator Kate Martinson. Refsal will be in the gallery again at 3:00 p.m. for another enameling demonstration.

At 2:00 p.m. in the museum’s Amdal-Odland Heritage Center, Curt Lund, graduate instructor at the University of Minnesota, will give the free presentation “Stores Like Homes, Homes Like Museum: Traditions in Scandinavian Design and Retailing.” Following the presentation, anyone with a piece of Norwegian enamel or a memory of Norwegian enamel is invited to share their piece and their story.

Lund’s presentation explores many of the traditions that we consider commonplace today, and reveals how innovative Scandinavian designers and retailers planted the seeds for these practices decades ago. Lund says, “Design is central to modern culture, whether it's the design of our houses, our cities, or our toasters. High-profile retailers borrow cues and strategies from both museums and modern domestic settings, while museums look more and more like stores. But this phenomenon isn't new—looking back through history, strong connections can be found between the traditions of the museum world, the retail world, and how we as consumers design and decorate our homes.” 

Curt Lund is an educator, designer, museum tour guide, writer/performer, and multimedia artist—all reflecting his passions for storytelling and for connecting words, images, and objects. At the University of Minnesota he focuses on design history and museum studies. He is also the design manager at Minnesota Center for Book Arts in Minneapolis and the co-curator of the exhibition "Alexey Brodovitch: Art Director" coming this summer to the Goldstein Museum of Design in St. Paul, Minnesota.

Vesterheim’s exhibition “Scandinavian Modern Design: Norwegian Enamel” focuses on Norwegian enamel design and enamel production (technology, innovation, and business). The exhibition features Grete Prytz Kittelsen, known as the “Queen of Scandinavian Design,” through her work for the firms Tostrup and Cathrineholm and showcases enamel jewelry, cookware, and tableware from Vesterheim’s collection and from individuals. The guest curator for the exhibition is Kate Martinson, Emeritus Professor of Art at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. The exhibition is sponsored by Mary Mills Dunea, Isabelle and R.L. Dyck, Becky and Bob Shaw, Humanities Iowa, and the National Endowment for the Humanities, with additional support.
