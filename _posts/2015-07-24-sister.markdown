“Sister,” the music trio of Kjersten Dysthe, Alisa Leonard, and Kara Millerhagen from Minnesota, brings positive energy, laughter, great music, and motivating messages to every show. 

We are excited to have them perform in Decorah during Nordic Fest—Friday and Saturday, July 24 and 25, at 3:00 p.m. in Decorah's Carrie Lee School Auditorium. The “Sister” concert is sponsored by Vesterheim and paid for in part by the Iowa Tourism Office.

“Sister” celebrates Norwegian heritage just as the band members were taught—invite the neighbors, sing from the bottom of your lungs, laugh from the bottom of your belly, and give from the bottom of your heart! Putting all of that energy into their performance makes the audience feel like part of the family. 

This trio had its beginnings on a small farm near Hanska, Minnesota, where they were “The Norvold Sisters.”  Singing in churches and learning classic three-part harmonies for performances at the local _Syttende Mai_ celebration gave them the roots that would later develop into their signature sound, which features their distinct harmony stack. Their vast repertoire includes standards, popular music, original compositions, Gospel classics, and a fun-filled Norwegian segment, which makes Sister second-to-none in variety. The trio creates all of their own arrangements from the perspective of Alisa, who is their lead vocalist, making them first-in-line for originality.  

Family has played a huge role in the performance life of “Sister” and many musicians, singers, and performers have blossomed in the family tree. Uncles Ron and Rolfe Johnstad of the Luther College Norseman Quartet have often said, “We’ve taught them everything they know!” Experience “Sister” and be part of the family!
