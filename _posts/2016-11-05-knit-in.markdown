Join us for a Knit-In. Everyone is welcome to come and knit, chat, listen to presentations, and take a behind-the-scenes tour of textile storage. The Knit-In is made possible by gifts in memory of Ann Swanson and Grace Rikansrud. 

Details will be announced soon. For more information, contact Laurann Gilbertson at Vesterheim (563-382-9681, lgilbertson@vesterheim.org).
