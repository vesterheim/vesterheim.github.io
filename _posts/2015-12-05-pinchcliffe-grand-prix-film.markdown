The stop-motion-animation classic family film _The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix_ will screen along with the short documentary _In the Stream (Bekken)_ during the Norwegian Christmas Celebration at 2:30 p.m. on December 5, 2015, in the Bethania Lutheran Church. 

Released in 1975, “The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix” is a Christmas staple in Norway, where it has sold more than five million tickets and is often broadcast on television around the holidays. 

Based on characters created by Norwegian author Kjell Aukrust, the film follows inventor Theodore Rimspoke and his friends Lambert (a hedgehog) and Sonny Duckworth (a magpie) as they build (and eventually race) a gigantic car to battle the villain who stole Rimspoke’s original engine design. 

_In the Stream (Bekken)_—a 10-minute short documentary—will precede the feature-length film. Directed by Ida Kleppe, the film explores the people of historic Havrå, a farm cluster on the west coast of Norway connected by a singular stream of water. 

The films are hosted by Oneota Film Festival and a free-will donations will be accepted at the event.
