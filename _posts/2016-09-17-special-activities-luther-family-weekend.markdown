On Saturday, September 17, 2016, during Luther College Family Weekend, Vesterheim is hosting special folk-art demonstrations and guided tours throughout the day. Vesterheim invites everyone to the museum to enjoy the activities as we welcome Luther families.

From 1:00-3:00 p.m., there will be folk art demonstrations throughout the Main Building and the historic buildings in the Open Air Division will be open with docents available to answer questions.
