Are you decorating gingerbread this year? Vesterheim invites folks of all ages to show off their homemade gingerbread creations in a “Gingerbread Fair” at the museum from December 2, 2016, through January 2, 2017. We are excited to display these local creations for people to admire. 

Gingerbread creations have had a long tradition in Scandinavia and Europe. The tradition continues to the present day, both in the United States and in Norway. The city of Bergen, Norway, is known for having the world’s largest gingerbread town each year.

Bring your decorated gingerbread creation to the Bruening Visitor Center at 502 W. Water St. between November 25 and December 1 from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. 

The gingerbread creations should be of edible materials, with bases not to exceed the size of a large pizza box. Fossum-Martin encourages bakers to be creative. Gingerbread creations can include buildings of all sorts, people, and decorative shapes. 

Each submission will receive a hand-decorated and edible gingerbread cookie as a thank you for participating. 

Making a gingerbread house can be a great Thanksgiving weekend activity for families and the start of a wonderful family tradition.

If you need help constructing your gingerbread house, Vesterheim’s Museum Store sells cookie cutters for large gingerbread houses and for gingerbread people and trolls. 

“In medieval Europe, gingerbread fairs were widely enjoyed, and gingerbread, baked in pretty shapes and gilded with spices, were bought as special gifts by fair-goers,” Darlene Fossum-Martin, Vesterheim Education Specialist, said. The “Gingerbread Fair” will include information about the history of gingerbread and examples by Vesterheim staff. 

The “Gingerbread Fair” will be on display at the Bruening Visitor Center and free to view, so all can enjoy during Decorah’s Holiday Parade the evening of December 2, Vesterheim’s Norwegian Christmas Celebration on December 3, and Christmas at Luther from December 1-3. 

Gingerbread creations must be picked up between January 3 and 13, 2017.
