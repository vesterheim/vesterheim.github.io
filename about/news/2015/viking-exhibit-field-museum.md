February 2015

The Vikings are coming to Chicago and so is Vesterheim Museum! Vesterheim has been invited to share information about its collection and programs at the opening event for the exhibition _Vikings,_ on March 18 from 6:00-9:00 p.m. at the [Field Museum](http://www.fieldmuseum.org/at-the-field/calendar/passport-scandinavia) in Chicago, Illinois.

Opening February 27 and running through October 4, The Field Museum’s presentation of Vikings is part of the series “Passport to …” designed to collaborate with the diverse community of Chicago. The concept for each event is a partnership. The museum presents one aspect of a community, through the given exhibition and members of the heritage community present other aspects of the culture as it is today in Chicago, including live music, food, and art from cultural centers and galleries.

We’re excited to be a part of this collaboration! During the opening event there will be live Scandinavian music, appetizers from Chicago-area Scandinavian restaurants, demonstrators, a cash bar, and more. Tickets are $35 until March 11, $40 until March 17, and $45 at the door. Visit [fieldmuseum.org](http://www.fieldmuseum.org/at-the-field/calendar/passport-scandinavia) to purchase tickets. Vesterheim supporters should use the code "VesterheimPassport" when purchasing or reserving tickets so that Vesterheim receives credit.  

The exhibition is the only U.S. stop on an international tour and it was organized by the Swedish History Museum in Sweden, in partnership with MuseumsPartner in Austria. 
The exhibition transports visitors to the Viking Age (8th-11th centuries) brought to light through modern archaeological discoveries. Nearly 500 ancient artifacts—many never before seen outside of Scandinavia—reveal new insights into the legendary people characterized as heartless marauders. 

Vikings brings a new appreciation for the people remembered mainly for their plundering ways. While raiding and pillaging were mainstays of their culture, Viking society was much more complex and multifaceted—Vikings were skilled craftsmen, successful merchants, and hard-working farmers. Like society today, no one thing defined the Vikings and research continues to teach us how nuanced these northern people were. 

The Field Museum gratefully acknowledges the support of the Chicago Park District on behalf of the people of Chicago.
