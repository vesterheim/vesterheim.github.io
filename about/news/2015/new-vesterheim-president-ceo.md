Vesterheim has hired a new President/CEO. Chris Johnson will take the helm of the renowned national Norwegian-American museum and heritage center beginning June 8 of this year, according to Vesterheim Board Chair Kate Martinson. 

“We are so happy to welcome Chris Johnson to our Vesterheim family,” Martinson said. “His local connections and past experience with the museum, coupled with his creative energy for positive change, make him a perfect fit for Vesterheim.”

“It is planned that Steve Johnson, Vesterheim’s outgoing Executive Director, will remain part of the leadership team until September 2016, when he officially retires, assuring a smooth transition,” Martinson explained.

The Vesterheim position represents a meaningful homecoming for Chris Johnson. A native of Northeast Iowa, he graduated from Luther College in 1987 with a B.A. in history, and he says that Vesterheim and the area around Decorah are places he has valued all his life. He did his graduate work at the University of Nebraska and an internship with Vesterheim in 1997, the same year he received his Masters in Museum Studies.

Since that time, Chris Johnson has worked for the State Historical Society of North Dakota, first as its Regional Historic Sites Manager from 1998 to 2007, and then as its Museum Division Director from 2007 to the present. 

Johnson was an integral part of a major expansion at the State Historical Society of North Dakota. He says he sees Vesterheim poised now for the same kind of dynamic growth and believes his experience with the North Dakota expansion will allow him to skillfully guide Vesterheim’s future development.  

“I want to help Vesterheim maintain its central cultural importance to Decorah and Northeast Iowa, and expand its facilities, programming, and outreach, both locally and nationally, while remaining financially sound,” he said.
