From Memorial Day, May 25, through Labor Day, September 7, Vesterheim will offer free admission to all active duty military personnel and their families, including National Guard and Reserve, through the Blue Star Museums program, a collaboration among the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), Blue Star Families, the Department of Defense, and museums across America. Leadership support has been provided by MetLife Foundation through Blue Star Families.

For the sixth year, Vesterheim is proud to join more than 2,000 museums in all 50 states in thanking military personnel and their families for their service and sacrifice. Vesterheim welcomes them to explore immigrant history and folk art through the lens of Norwegian Americans and hopes many families will take advantage of this summer program.
  
“Blue Star Museums has grown into a nationally recognized program that service members and their families look forward to each year,” said Blue Star Families Chief Executive Officer Kathy Roth-Douquet. “It helps bring our local military and civilian communities together, and offers families fun and enriching activities. We are thrilled with the continued growth of the program and the unparalleled opportunities it offers.”

Blue Star Families is a national, non-partisan, non-profit network of military families from all ranks and services including guard and reserve, with a mission to support, connect, and empower military families. The National Endowment for the Arts is a public agency dedicated to supporting excellence in the arts, bringing the arts to all Americans, and providing leadership in arts education.

The National Endowment for the Arts was established by Congress in 1965 as an independent agency of the federal government. To date, the NEA has awarded more than $4 billion to support artistic excellence, creativity, and innovation for the benefit of individuals and communities. The NEA extends its work through partnerships with state arts agencies, local leaders, other federal agencies, and the philanthropic sector.
