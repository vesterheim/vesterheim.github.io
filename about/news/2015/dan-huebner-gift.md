December 2015

We are honored to announce that Vesterheim has received the largest gift in its 138 year history! 

In 2004, Dan and Bonnie Huebner established the Dan and Bonnie Huebner Endowment for the Westby-Torgerson Education Center to support educational programming at Vesterheim. After Dan’s passing earlier this year, he enhanced their named endowment, and thus the entire folk art education program, with a generous bequest that is the largest Vesterheim has received.

Next year marks the 50th Anniversary of Vesterheim’s Folk Art School program. Though small at first, the Folk Art School quickly grew and now offers over 40 classes annually. The classes at Vesterheim reflect the rich diversity in Norwegian folk art, connecting students to Scandinavian material culture by creating functional and beautiful objects with their own hands—a rewarding experience beyond compare. 

Dan and Bonnie’s financial support has helped create and maintain the classrooms, support events, and conduct countless education programs such as the fourth-grade Pioneer Immersion Program, currently sponsored by the “Deck the Tables” event at the Hotel Winneshiek each November, and hundreds of folk-art classes. The remarkable stewardship of the Huebners has made it possible for people of all ages to celebrate heritage and tradition. Dan and Bonnie knew it wouldn’t take much to get involved with the museum and make an impact on the entire Scandinavian community, but they regularly strove to go above and beyond, leaving an indelible mark on Vesterheim.

The Huebners’ involvement with Vesterheim started in 1994, while they were living in Fairfield, Connecticut. Bonnie had grown up up in Houston, Minnesota, with Norwegian-American parents, and attended St. Olaf College. Dan was from Minneapolis and attended the University of Minnesota. With their roots in the Midwest, and having some ties to the museum, they eventually made their home in Decorah when Dan retired as Vice Chairman and Director of the Grumman Corporation. 

In 1997, they were jointly appointed to the Vesterheim Board of Trustees, served as co-chairs of its Audit Committee, and were members of the Long Range Planning Committee. During their tenure, they joined the museum’s Valhalla Society for planned giving, were members of _Kroneklubben,_ Vesterheim’s Crown Club for exceptional donors, and received the _Mange Takk_ award—bestowed upon selected trustees whose dedication translates into extra ordinary contributions to Vesterheim. Bonnie passed away in 2004.

Dan honored Bonnie’s memory in countless ways, not the least of which was continuing the work they began together to preserve and promote education at Vesterheim and Scandinavian customs. He chaired the the museum’s Committee on Trustees and Governance, started the “Think Tank” advisory group, and served as Chair of the Board of Trustees. He received the _Den Høyeste Ære_ (The Highest Honor) recognition in 2013 from his fellow board members. This special award has only been presented three times since 1993!

We are grateful beyond words to Bonnie and Dan for a lifetime of distinguished service to Vesterheim—as donors, members, trustees, and friends. They not only shared their passion for preservation with thousands of museum goers, but instilled the fervor for safeguarding Scandinavian culture in their own family as well: Their daughter, Cindi Alan, continues their legacy and serves on the Vesterheim Board.  

Dan and Bonnie’s dedication and love of Vesterheim have made many enriching opportunities possible for the museum and the Decorah community. We are very humbled by their extraordinary gifts, which will go far into the future to support education at Vesterheim.
