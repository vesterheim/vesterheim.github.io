January 2015

This spring, Vesterheim will pay forward the generosity of our members and supporters by giving free admission to more than 300 children.
 
For every $100 donated to Vesterheim from November 15, 2014 – February 15, 2015 a child receives free admission! Each child will also receive a card letting them know that a kind stranger has paid for their visit to the museum and encouraging them to pay it forward.
 
Everything that Vesterheim does, every aspect of its mission, is about paying it forward for future generations. Our high-quality exhibitions, events, classes, and other programming—which would not be possible without our members—are all geared toward passing on history, heritage, and living traditions to others. What better legacy to share than the knowledge of who we are, where we come from, and what we have in common?
 
With your support we can make Vesterheim, and the world, a better place, one good deed at a time.
 
Thank you!
