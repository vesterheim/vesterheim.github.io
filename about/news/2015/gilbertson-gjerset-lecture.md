Vesterheim’s Chief Curator Laurann Gilbertson will present Luther College’s fifth annual Knut Gjerset lecture at 7:00 p.m. Thursday, March 26, in the Recital Hall of the Center for Faith and Life on the Luther College campus in Decorah, Iowa.

In the presentation “Gifts from Norway,” Gilbertson will speak about the artifacts in Vesterheim’s collection that were sent as gifts from Norwegian museums in the 1920s and 30s. The objects remain important today and are among the artifacts most frequently studied and exhibited at Vesterheim.  

The lecture honors former Luther Professor Knut Gjerset and is sponsored by Luther's Department of Modern Languages, Literatures and Linguistics (Nordic Studies). Gjerset served as a professor of history and Norwegian at Luther from 1902 to his retirement in 1934. He also worked as curator of the collection that would later become Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum and was curator when the gifts were sent from Norway. 

A reception will follow the lecture in Qualley Lounge of the Center for Faith and Life. The lecture and reception are open to the public with no charge for admission.

Gilbertson holds a bachelor's degree in anthropology and a master's degree in textiles and clothing from Iowa State University. She has worked at the Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum for 23 years, where she started as Textile Curator and is now Chief Curator.
