Vesterheim is proud to return King Olav’s 1951 Cadillac limousine to the people of Norway by transferring the classic one-of-a-kind vehicle into the care of the American Car Club of Norway (AMCAR). AMCAR members buy and restore vintage American cars.

King Olav V of Norway bought the Cadillac after the Second World War. It symbolized Norway’s road to recovery and became the King’s favorite car.

While he was still Crown Prince, King Harald V of Norway donated his father’s Cadillac to the International Disabilities Foundation (IDF) to be used for fundraising for the IDF in conjunction with the Sons of Norway. The limousine appeared at various Scandinavian-American events throughout the United States before it was given to Vesterheim in 1994. 

In 2013, AMCAR learned that Vesterheim owned the King's Cadillac, and the club’s president, Harry Kjensli, contacted the museum regarding their interest in obtaining the car and restoring it. Norway is in the process of developing a National Motor Museum north of Lillehammer and the King's Cadillac eventually will be on permanent exhibit there along with King Olav’s other limousines.

“AMCAR’s desire and ability to fully restore the King’s Cadillac was timely and Vesterheim is happy to play a role in getting the car to its new museum home in Norway,” Steve Johnson, Vesterheim’s Executive Director, said. 

There was an unveiling of the restored car at noon on June 6 at Akershus Fortress in Oslo, Norway, and Vesterheim Trustee Mette Bowen represented Vesterheim at the festivities.

King Harald V is the Honorary Chair of Vesterheim’s Board of Trustees and has visited the museum four times. King Olav V also visited four times, and Crown Prince Haakon once.
