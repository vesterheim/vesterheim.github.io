January 2015

On December 5, 2014, Vesterheim signed a purchase agreement with the Cary Family Trust for the buildings now occupied by Cary Machine and Welding on West Water Street adjacent to the museum. Closing on the agreement is expected May 1, 2015. For almost forty years Vesterheim has worked toward this acquisition as part of the museum’s strategic plan for a unified campus, but discussions about how the space will be used in the short term are ongoing. Vesterheim is grateful to Bill Cary, J.R. Cary, the Cary Family Trust, and all the museum trustees present and past who have helped make this longtime dream come true.
