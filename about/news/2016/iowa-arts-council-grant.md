Vesterheim is pleased to announce that it has received a Cultural Leadership Partner Operating Support Grant from the Iowa Arts Council, a division of the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs. Grant funds will support Vesterheim's many activities, such as the 2016 exhibition _Fifty Years of Folk Art_ and the printing of the 2017 Folk Art School catalog.

The grant creates opportunities for the arts to flourish in Iowa by investing in projects that positively impact the vitality of the arts in the state, demonstrate public value, and support Iowa Arts Council funding priorities. 

“Through this investment and partnership, the Iowa Arts Council and Vesterheim are working hand-in-hand to ensure that the stories of Iowa are preserved and communicated to connect past, present, and future generations," said Vesterheim President/CEO Chris Johnson. "We're so fortunate to receive this public arts funding.”

The Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs and its three divisions—the Iowa Arts Council; Produce Iowa-State Office of Media Production; and the State Historical Society of Iowa—empower Iowa to build and sustain culturally vibrant communities by connecting Iowans to the people, places, and points of pride that define our state. The department’s work enables Iowa to be recognized as a state that fosters creativity and serves as a catalyst for innovation.
