Vesterheim is pleased to announce that it has received a grant from The American-Scandinavian Foundation (ASF). The $2,250 award from ASF’s Andrew E. and G. Norman Wigeland Fund was given to help cover the costs of bringing Norwegian instructors Britt Solheim and Turid Helle Fatland to teach at Vesterheim’s Folk Art School.
  
For over 50 years, Vesterheim has brought instructors from Norway to its Folk Art School to teach traditional Norwegian folk arts. “Vesterheim’s Folk Art School is so popular among artists and crafts people, not just because we offer unique classes in Norwegian folk arts, but because the expert instructors are ‘top notch’ in their subject areas and their teaching abilities,” Darlene Fossum-Martin, Vesterheim’s Education Specialist, said. “Students, instructors, and staff all love the exchange of skills, ideas, and creativity that happen when Scandinavians come to Vesterheim and, with the help of the American-Scandinavian Foundation, we will continue to build a community of international artists as we move into the next 50 years of classes.”

With the help of ASF, two instructors came in 2016. Britt Solheim, of Gjøvik, Norway, taught how to make and decorate skinnfell, a sheepskin coverlet. The smooth side of these beautiful coverlets are printed with solar motifs, water, plants, animals, hearts, and flowing borders, or covered with a handwoven textile. Solheim has been teaching classes in skinnfell sewing and printing in Norway, Finland, and Sweden. She also produces both traditional and modern skinnfell. Her book _Skinnfeller du kan lage selv (Skinnfells You Can Make Yourself)_ was published in 2006.

Turid Helle Fatland from Etne, Norway, taught Rogaland rosemaling. Rosemaling is the decorative painting of Norway and the many different styles come from the many different regions of the country. Fatland has been painting rosemaling since 1976. Today, she paints original pieces in the Rogaland and Telemark styles and does restoration work.

The American-Scandinavian Foundation (ASF) is an American non-profit organization that promotes firsthand exchange of intellectual and creative influence between the United States and the Nordic countries—Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. ASF offers fellowships, cultural grants, internships/training, publications, exhibitions, and other public programs reinforcing the strong relationships between the two regions. Each year, they offer over $500,000 in funding to Scandinavians to undertake study or research programs in the United States.
