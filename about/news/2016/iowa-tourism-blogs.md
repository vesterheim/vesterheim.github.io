Do you want to spread the word about a place you love? Do you like to write or take pictures or videos? Iowa has two blogs, [Imagine Northeast Iowa](http://www.imaginenortheastiowa.com/) and [Travel Iowa](http://blog.traveliowa.com/), and we are encouraging you to send in your stories about Vesterheim and Decorah and your experiences visiting the museum and the area.

What should you write about? Anything! What was your experience taking a class, viewing an exhibit, enjoying the area? Or maybe you know the family history of a certain Vesterheim artifact, or want to share the biography of your favorite Vesterheim artist. What’s it like to have your artwork in Vesterheim’s National Exhibition? What are your 10 favorite folk-art pieces in the museum’s collection? When you visit Vesterheim, what are your other favorite places to go in the area?

Both blogs are easy to work with. Just send your written piece and one picture to their submissions address at these links [Imagine Northeast Iowa](http://www.imaginenortheastiowa.com/) and [Travel Iowa](http://blog.traveliowa.com/). You can also send a video with a short written explanation. The blogs each have an editor who will post your piece on the site. You might even get paid! The top blog post of the week wins $15-$20. If you have more questions, don’t hesitate to contact Becky Idstrom at [bidstrom@vesterheim.org](mailto:bidstrom@vesterheim.org) and she’ll give you more info.
