Vesterheim’s Folk Art School is celebrating it’s fiftieth year! We're planning an exhibition to celebrate the people, the products, and the program from 1967 to today. The exhibition will be on view in the museum’s Hong Gallery from September 3, 2016, until April 23, 2017.

To help us celebrate, share a memory about a class or tour. Take a moment, answer one of the questions below, and send it via email or mail to Laurann Gilbertson at [lgilbertson@vesterheim.org](mailto:lgilbertson.vesterheim.org), or P.O. Box 379, Decorah IA 52101. We might use a portion of your answer in the exhibition. 

• Tell us about one teacher (American or Norwegian) who you consider to be the most (or one of the most) influential in your artistic development. <br />
• Tell us about your very first class at Vesterheim. Why did you take the class and what lesson resonates the most even today?<br />
• If you’ve been on a Vesterheim folk-art tour, what one experience (person, class, museum visit) has had the most dramatic impact on your painting and why?<br />
• Tell us about a folk-art milestone. What event or person should be remembered as significant in the museum’s history? Please include the year to mark on our timeline.<br />
• Does Norwegian folk art speak to your identity? If so, in what way?<br />
• Why do you keep returning to Vesterheim for classes? Please include the year to mark on our timeline.<br />
• Do you have photographs from class? We are especially interested in finding photos from the early years (1967-1975). Staff will scan and return them. <br />
