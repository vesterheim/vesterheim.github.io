Vesterheim’s Folk Art School is celebrating it’s fiftieth year! We're planning an exhibition to celebrate the people, the products, and the program from 1967 to today. The exhibition will be on view in the museum’s Hong Gallery from September 3, 2016, until April 23, 2017.

To help us celebrate, share a memory about a class or tour. Take a moment, answer one of the questions below, and send it via email or mail to Laurann Gilbertson at [lgilbertson@vesterheim.org](mailto:lgilbertson@vesterheim.org), or P.O. Box 379, Decorah IA 52101. We might use a portion of your answer in the exhibition. 

* Who is a Vesterheim teacher you consider to be significant and why?
* What has been your favorite class at Vesterheim?
* Why did you decide to take a class at Vesterheim?
* What is one important lesson you learned in a class Vesterheim?
* What one experience on Vesterheim folk-art tour has had the most dramatic impact on your art and why?
* What do you enjoy most about making things by hand?
* Why do you keep returning to Vesterheim for classes?
* Do you have photographs from class at Vesterheim? We are especially interested in finding photos from the early years (1967-1975). Let us know and we’ll make arrangements to borrow them to scan if possible.
