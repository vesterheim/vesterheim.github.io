October 2014

Gundersen Health System of La Crosse, Wisconsin, has renewed their five-year commitment (2015-2019) to be the sole sponsor of the WOW (Window on the World) Program at Vesterheim. Each year, about 240 Decorah-area third-grade students and their teachers, parents, grandparents, and other adults participate in the WOW Program, which helps students understand change over time through changes in technology.

Over the past five years (2010-2014), Gundersen’s sponsorship has doubled the numbers served. “Vesterheim is extremely grateful for Gundersen’s consistent support to make this educational and engaging program free for all participants,” Steve Johnson, Vesterheim’s Executive Director, said.
 
During the program, students can invite an adult family member or friend to accompanying them on a visit to Vesterheim, where they try their hands at apple pressing, making rope, shelling and grinding corn, and flailing or hand-threshing grain using tools and machines from the past.
 
In 2014, apples were provided by the Luster Heights Work Camp, oats were provided by Michael Bergan, and corn was provided by Roger Bergan. Many Vesterheim and RSVP volunteers assisted with the activities.
