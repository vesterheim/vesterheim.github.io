### Job: Upgrading two portions of our website

Our website has recently undergone a major upgrade and two large database sections are now out of date. Our Gold Medalist Virtual Portfolio honors over a hundred artists awarded Gold Medals for excellence in Norwegian-style rosemaling, woodworking, weaving, and knifemaking at our annual _National Exhibition of Folk Art in the Norwegian Tradition_ and our Civil War Database contains information on over ten thousand Civil War soldiers born in Norway. They look different from our current site, the current content is difficult to manage, and data needs updating. 

### Duties

The Gold Medalist Portfolio is a priority:

* Contact and work with artists to update or create their pages for this database.
* Ensure the accuracy of data transferred from the current CSV format to the new YAML and Markdown format.
* Manage the portfolio with Jekyll, a simple, static site generator.

If time allows:

* Update and correct entries in the Civil War database.
* Parse and format the Civil War database in a more structured way.
* Other web-related duties as assigned.

### Necessary Qualifications

* Personable, outgoing, enthusiastic, positive attitude.
* Reliable, responsible, flexible.
* Excellent communication (written and oral) and interpersonal skills.
* Comfortable speaking to people of all ages and backgrounds.
* Organized, with strong attention to detail.
* Perseverance and determination to see projects through to completion.
* Willingness to learn.
* Able to accept supervision.
* Intermediate computer/Internet/Office Suite skills.
* Ability to work with Adobe Photoshop and a text editor.

### Preferred candidates will have

* Understanding of data manipulation and how to work with spreadsheets.
* Comfortable using command-line tools.
* An ability to think outside of the box.
* Demonstrated experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Interest in Jekyll or static site generators.

### Terms

This position is paid $7.35 per hour for 170 hours (generally 20 hours per week for 8.5 weeks). Specific work schedules are flexible. 

### Apply

Applications should be directed to Vesterheim's Technology Specialist Faust Gertz at [fgertz@vesterheim.org](mailto:fgertz@vesterheim.org). Applications should include a cover letter and current resume explaining interest and relevant experience. Applications will be accepted through April 24, 2015, or until position is filled.
