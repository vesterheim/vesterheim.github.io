The following job opportunity is currently available at Vesterheim.

PRESIDENT AND CEO
-----------------
{: .heading--black--large }

Vesterheim seeks a dynamic and skilled professional to lead the institution as it expands and strengthens its campus and programming in accordance with its long-range plan and campus development plan. Reporting directly to the Board of Trustees, the President and CEO has all the leadership and management responsibilities normally associated with the position of chief executive officer.

Leading candidates will have significant leadership and administrative experience, including understanding of institutional budgeting, finance and development; familiarity with educational and cultural organizations; and a strong interest in the immigrant experience, ideally the Nordic experience. The position is available summer 2015 or earlier.

### MUSEUM

Through its collections, exhibitions, events, educational programs, publications, and tours to Norway, Vesterheim tells the story of Norwegians in America and, increasingly, the story of “Norway today.” Founded in Decorah in 1877 in conjunction with Luther College, an esteemed liberal-arts institution, Vesterheim moved in 1933 to a larger location in downtown Decorah where it occupies its own campus now featuring a collection of 12 relocated historic buildings, some of which are on the National Historic register. (Vesterheim formally separated from the college in 1964.) The museum’s campus and collections currently encompass more than 24,000 artifacts, a folk art school, a library and archives.

Vesterheim, an AAM-accredited 501(c)(3) organization, is governed by a national board of trustees with H.M. King Harald V of Norway as Honorary Chair. It has an endowment (exclusive of its collections) of approximately $5.8 million. Operating on a budget of $2 million, the museum’s 25-person staff and 300 volunteers annually host over 15,000 visitors and 2,600 students from 50 states and 35 foreign countries. The museum is in the planning stages of a multi-million-dollar capital campaign expected to be launched in 2015. 

### Apply

Applications and nominations should be directed to [directorsearch@vesterheim.org](mailto:directorsearch@vesterheim.org). Applications should include a current resume and letter explaining interest and relevant experience. Applications will be accepted between November 15 and December 31, 2014.
