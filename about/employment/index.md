The following job opportunity is currently available at Vesterheim.

Chief Development Officer 
-----------------
{: .heading--black--large }

Vesterheim seeks to hire a Chief Development Officer (CDO) who can lead fundraising efforts through donor visits and contributions and be successful in meeting the financial needs of the museum. As a nonprofit, forty percent of Vesterheim’s operating budget comes from donations. The American Alliance of Museums indicates that sixty percent is the goal. This goal, in addition to embarking on a campaign in the next year or two, requires an individual with five to seven years fundraising experience, including experience with capital campaign management; proven leadership ability; excellent verbal and written communication skills; the ability to build strong relationships with donors, trustees, volunteers, and staff members; and proficiency in the use of computer applications such as: email, Word, and fundraising software (Raiser’s Edge preferred). 

Vesterheim cares for over 24,000 objects, among which are some of the most outstanding examples of decorative and folk art to be seen in this country. Our mission is to preserve and promote living traditions through exhibitions, educational programs, folk art classes, events, and tours to Norway. It is estimated that the museum's 15,000 visitors per year from 50 states and 35 foreign countries have an economic impact of $5 million to the Decorah area. Strategic priorities for the museum are to improve access to non-exhibited collections; expand Vesterheim’s traveling exhibition program, including an exhibit that can travel to schools and libraries; and to plan and implement campaigns to strengthen financial resources to grow the museum’s endowment and meet long range goals. Vesterheim is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. The museum received Trip Advisor’s Certificate of Excellence and was named one of "15 Best Small-Town Museums in the U.S." by Fodors travel guide. Forbes named Decorah one of "America's Prettiest Towns" with Vesterheim featured. Decorah was also named by _Smithsonian Magazine_ as one of 20 great small towns to visit with Vesterheim listed as a major reason.
