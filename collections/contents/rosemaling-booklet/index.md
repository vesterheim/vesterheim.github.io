This booklet is designed to provide visitors to Vesterheim with some basic information about the painted Norwegian folk art known as rosemaling. It is hoped that, with this booklet, those who come to view rosemaling, perhaps for the first time, will gain a greater appreciation of the folk artâ€™s beauty and variety by providing some background history and insights. 

The project is in memory of Marlys Hammer, a Vesterheim Gold Medalist in rosemaling, who dedicated much of her adult life to sharing the art form she loved, as a teacher, promoter, and encourager.

This project was made possible through generous donations from the friends of Marlys Hammer. Special thanks to Judy Ritger and Patti Goke for their work in creating the booklet.
