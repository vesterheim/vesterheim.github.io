Said to have walked from Waseca County, Minnesota, to Madison, Wisconsin, to enlist in the all-Norwegian 15th Infantry. That unit had already left Madison when he arrived, so he joined the 17th, an all-Irish regiment. Enlisted for three years on 5 Mar 1862 at Madison. Mustered there the same day. Private. Wounded in the Battle for Atlanta, Georgia, on 2 Aug 1864 and died of his wounds eight days later. Buried in the National Cemetery at Atlanta.
