US Navy. Born 1842 in Kristiansand, Norway. Civil War: Enlisted from Massachusetts. Seaman. Awarded the Medal of Honor. On board the &#147;U.S.S. Santiago de Cuba&#148; during the assault by the fleet on Fort Fisher, on 15 Jan 1865. When the landing party to which he was attached charged on the fort with a cheer and with determination to plant their colors on the ramparts, Williams remained steadfast when they reached the foot of the fort and more than two-thirds of the marines and sailors fell back in panic. Taking cover when the enemy concentrated his fire on the remainder of the group, Williams alone remained with his executive officer, subsequently withdrawing from the field after dark.
