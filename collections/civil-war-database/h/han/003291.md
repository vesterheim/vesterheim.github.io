WI 15th Inf Co K. Residence: Calumet County, Wisconsin. From Rannestad, Norway. Civil War: Age 35. Married. Enlisted for three years on 16 Nov 1861 in Calumet County and mustered at Madison, Wisconsin, 11 Feb 1862. Private. Sick in Nashville, Tennessee, in December 1862 and in Manchester in July 1863. Taken prisoner at Chickamauga, Georgia, 20 Sep 1863. Died of diarrhea in Andersonville Prison 23 Jun 1864. Buried there in grave 2384 (2854). Named Brevet (Honorary) Captain on 7 Jun 1867 with rank from 19 Sep 1863 in recognition of the bravery and courage he displayed in the Battle of Chickamauga. The 15th was under a strong attack and had to fall back. As it did so, the Regiment&#146;s standard bearer was seriously wounded and the flag fell. Private Hanson, exposing himself to murderous fire, ran forward and rescued the flag from the hands of the Rebels.
