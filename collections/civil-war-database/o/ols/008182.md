Private. Promoted to Corporal 18 Sep 1862. Promoted to Sergeant 1 May 1863. Taken prisoner at Chickamauga, Georgia, 20 Sep 1863. It was said he survived the battlefield, but he likely died among the Rebels because he was never mustered out, and there were no reports about him after he was taken prisoner.
