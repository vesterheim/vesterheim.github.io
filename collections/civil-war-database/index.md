This database contains information on Civil War soldiers born in Norway, plus many born in Sweden and Denmark. It also includes information on men serving in other American wars, from the Revolutionary War (two men, so far) to the Second World War.

Vesterheim’s Norwegians in the Civil War project is made possible through the generous support of Hamlet and Suzanne Peterson, Rochester, Minn., and a grant from Humanities Iowa and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

The companion volume _Ole Goes to War: Men from Norway who Fought in America’s Civil War,_ by Jerry Rosholt, was made possible through a gift from the Government of Norway in honor of Vesterheim’s 125th Anniversary.
