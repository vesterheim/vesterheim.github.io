WI Lt Arty 8th Battery. Born in Norway. Civil War: Farmer. Age 19. Blue eyes, light hair, light complexion, 5&#146;9&#148;. His attempt to re-enlist as a veteran in this battery was rejected because of no evidence of his original muster-in. His entry on the roll was red-lined. His name appears nowhere else in the Eighth Battery records in the Wisconsin Archives. Sources: (WHS Series 1200 box 239-3)
