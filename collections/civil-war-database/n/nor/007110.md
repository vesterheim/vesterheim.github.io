Helped establish the town of Mandan. Indian War: Hired to escort an army unit in pursuit of Chief Sitting Bull following the Battle of the Little Big Horn. He led the unit across the river to the battlefield where they found the corpses of General Custer and his 365 officers and men. Nordstrom had to return to Fort Lincoln in North Dakota to get paid for his services as a scout and while he waited for his money to come from Washington DC he rode out to find the land he wished to homestead. Post war: Married Maria Olsdatter Strandvold (sic). Eventually they moved to Victoria, Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Chris died 6 Jan 1918.
