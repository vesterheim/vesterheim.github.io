Absent without leave from Mar 1862 until Oct 1864. Found to have taken a medical examination on 9 Apr 1864 at Pass Hospital in Tyler, Texas. He was found to be incapable of service because of varicose veins. He was assigned as a shoemaker in Tyler, until he was arrested for being AWOL in late Oct 1864, imprisoned for two months; then brought back to his regiment near Minden, Louisiana, in late Dec 1864 to work as a harness maker. He apparently had been freed of the charges against him. Post war: He died 12 Aug 1903 in Bosque County,Texas.
