US Army 33rd Div 132nd Inf, Co H. Born 24 Aug 1886 at Bergen, Norway. First World War: Enlisted at Chicago, Illinois. Private. Awarded Medal of Honor. Near Consenvoye, France, on 9 Oct 1918. When his company had reached a point within 100 yards of its objective, to which it was advancing under terrific machinegun fire, Private Loman, voluntarily and unaided, made his way forward after all others had taken shelter from the direct fire of an enemy machinegun. He crawled to a flank position of the gun and, after killing or capturing the entire crew, turned the machine gun on the retreating enemy.
