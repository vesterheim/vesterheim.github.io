ND 1st Inf Co D. Born in Denmark. Philippines War: Enlisted from Devils Lake, North Dakota. Private. Awarded the Medal of Honor. With eleven other scouts, without waiting for the supporting battalion to aid them or to get into a position to do so, he charged over a distance of about 150 yards and completely routed about 300 of the enemy, who were in line and in a position that could only be carried by a frontal attack.
