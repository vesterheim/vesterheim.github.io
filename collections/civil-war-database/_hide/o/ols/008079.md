WI 15th Inf Co F. Residence: Decorah, Winneshiek County, Iowa. Born &quot;Knut Olsen Ygre&quot; in Voss, Sogn, Norway. Civil War: Age 18. Unmarried. Enlisted for three years on 25 Dec 1861 at Decorah and mustered at Madison, Wisconsin, 29 Dec 1861. Private. Wounded at Chickamauga, Georgia, 20 Sep 1863, and taken prisoner. He was held in Libby Prison, Richmond, Virginia. What eventually happened to him is unknown; he was still a prisoner at time of his regiment&#146;s muster out. Other records indicate he was discharged from the service 4 Nov 1865 (1864?) from the post hospital in Camp Randall, Madison, Wisconsin, because of inflammation on his left side.
