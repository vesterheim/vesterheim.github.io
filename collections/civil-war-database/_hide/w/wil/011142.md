US Navy. Born 1831 in Norway. Civil War: Enlisted from Pennsylvania. Awarded the Medal of Honor. As quartermaster on board the &#147;U.S.S. Ironclad Steamer Monitor&#148;, at Hampton Roads, at the mouth of the James River, on 9 Mar 1862, he was at the helm. During the engagement between the &#147;U.S.S. Monitor&#148; and the &#147;C.S.S. Merrimack&#148;, the &#147;Merrimack&#148; was trying to attack the warship &#147;Minnesota&#148;, which was grounded on a sand bar and awaiting the next high tide. The &#147;Monitor&#148; went forth to protect the &#147;Minnesota&#148;. Williams &#147;gallantly served throughout the engagement, piloting the Monitor throughout the battle which ended when the Merrimack, after being damaged, retired from the scene of the battle&#148;. When a shell from the Merimack slammed into the pilot house and blinded Captain John Worden, Williams never left his post. A US Navyman named Peter Williams died on 31 May 1863 and is buried in Plot 12 in Mt. Moriah Cemetery, Philadelphia. Sources: (&#147;America&#146;s Medal of Honor Recipients&#148;.
