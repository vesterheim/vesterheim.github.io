Born in Farsund, Norway, in 1839. Grew up in Oslo. Went to sea in 1858 on the bark &quot;Deodota&quot; and did not return to Norway until 1911 when he made a visit. Civil War: Came on a ship to New Orleans during the Civil war and was pressed into Confederate service. He escaped and entered the Union Navy. He is said to have been the only Norwegian sailor on record to see service under Flag Officer Foote and General Grant on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, when the Confederates surrendered Forts Henry and Donelson to the Union army. Later he served under Admiral Porter at Vicksburg. Later he enlisted as a soldier and fought at Petersburg, where he lost a finger. He became a Lieutenant and, after the war, was raised to Captain. He became a sailing master on the Great Lakes, living in Oswego, New York. He eventually retired to New York City. Sources: (Rygg p52)
