Vesterheim’s *Norwegians in the Civil War* project is made possible through the generous support of Hamlet and Suzanne Peterson, Rochester, Minn., and a grant from Humanities Iowa and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

The companion volume *Ole Goes to War: Men from Norway who Fought in America’s Civil War*, by Jerry Rosholt, was made possible through a gift from the Government of Norway in honor of Vesterheim’s 125th Anniversary.
