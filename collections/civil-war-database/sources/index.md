Military Records
----------------

Soldiers were to be paid every other month (and sometimes were) and company clerks prepared muster rolls listing all members of the company and showing which soldiers were on hand to get their money. Each of these muster rolls was copied from the one used two months earlier, and each showed the soldier’s name, place of birth, age, enlistment dates and rank. Each company clerk kept one copy, sent one to the regimental headquarters, sent one to the War Department in Washington, D.C., and sent one to the adjutant general of the state from which the unit came. After the war, legislatures ordered that this information be copied and printed and that was done. In some states - Wisconsin is one - the original muster rolls still exist.
