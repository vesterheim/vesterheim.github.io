US Navy. Born 1824 in Norway. Civil War: Enlisted from New York. Seaman. Awarded the Medal of Honor. As seaman on board the U.S.S. Metacomet, Johnson served as a member of the boat&#146;s crew which went to the rescue of the U.S. Monitor Tecumseh when that vessel was struck by a torpedo in passing the enemy forts in Mobile Bay on 5 Aug 1864. He braved the enemy fire which was said by the admiral to be &#147;one of the most galling&#148; he had ever seen. Johnson aided in rescuing from death ten of the crew of the Tecumseh, eliciting admiration of friend and foe. Sources: (&#147;America&#146;s Medal of Honor Recipients&#148;, publ. 1977, pp 131, 1015)
