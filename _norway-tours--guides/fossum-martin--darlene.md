**Darlene Fossum-Martin,** Vesterheim’s Education Specialist, led Vesterheim Folk Art Tours to Norway in 2001, 2003, and 2014. Darlene loves Vesterheim’s folk-art program—the arts, artists, instructors, and students. She enjoys everyone’s enthusiasm for learning the art and its historical context. She attributes her strong Norwegian ties and traditions to the women in her family, her community, and years spent living, working, and traveling in Norway. She looks forward to sharing her love of the Norwegian countryside and its cultural richness while on this tour.
