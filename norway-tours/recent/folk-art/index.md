This tour was such a huge success in 2014, Darlene and Patti led it again in 2016.

This immersion into the traditional folk arts of rosemaling and woodcarving included visits to nine of the nineteen _fylke_ (counties) of Norway. The tour began in the city of Trondheim in Sør-Trøndelag and traveled through Oppland, More og Romsdal, Sogn og  Fjordane, Oppland, Buskerud, Telemark, Aust-Agder, and Hordaland.

Through Vesterheim’s close friendships in Norway, we enjoyed special events at artists’ studios, private collections, museums, historic hotels, stave churches, and bygdetunets. We visited with Norwegian folk artists who have shared so much of their talent with Vesterheim, many of whom the tour group visited on the Folk Art Pilgrimage Tour in 2014. We got a firsthand look at various rosemaling styles and carving techniques. We saw both old traditions and contemporary designs that follow those old traditions. 

There were also wonderful opportunities for hands-on artistic experiences, scholarly lectures, and evening discussions. This jam-packed folk-art study tour kept us moving.
