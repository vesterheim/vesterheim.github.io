Vesterheim's seventh Textile Study Tour focused on the textiles and traditions of both coastal Norway and the _Sámi_ people. Participants learned about weaving, knitting, sewing, and folk costumes while traveling through Norway's northernmost counties with stops in Tromsø, Samuelsberg, Alta, Máze, and Kautokeino. There were special opportunities to learn about _Sámi_ _duodji_ (functional items made beautiful) and to try several textile techniques. _Syttende Mai_, Norwegian Constitution Day, was enjoyed with parades, music, and beautiful national costumes.
