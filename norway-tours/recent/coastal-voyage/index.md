**Tour Guide: Knut Werner-Hagen** <br />
**Tour Leader: Michelle Whitehill**

On this tour Vesterheim added it's special touch to the Hurtigruten’s classic Norwegian coastal voyage to make an unforgettable travel experience. The tour was so popular, we had to add a second one. With the help of tour guide, Knut Werner Hagen, every day of this incredible trip was filled with one-of-a-kind opportunities to explore Norway and see breathtaking scenery, both on land and at sea. Knut shared his knowledge and respect for the beauty and history of his beloved Norway throughout the entire tour. Beginning in Bergen and ending in Kirkenes, this voyage took participants through the calm, sheltered waters of Norway’s shores—close to the landscape, wildlife, and culture. Participants spent days and nights filled with majestic coastal Norway—awe-inspiring fjords, expansive sounds, snow-capped mountains, scenic skerries, and picturesque plains. The 34 ports of call, both historical and cosmopolitan, ranged from major cities to small fishing hamlets, and the stops varied from 45 minutes to 6 hours.
