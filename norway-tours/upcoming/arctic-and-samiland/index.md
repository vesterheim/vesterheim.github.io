**July 3-20, 2014** <br />
**Tour Guide: Harley Refsal** <br />
**Tour Leader: Michelle Whitehill**

Take the exciting, picturesque, less-commonly traveled road north!

Vesterheim’s adventure above the Arctic Circle will focus on northern Norway and Sámiland. Beginning at Kiruna, Sweden, traveling primarily by motor coach, but also by coastal steamer, the tour will focus on the history and rich traditions of the _Sámi_ as we visit cultural centers and museums both in Norway and Sweden. Attention will also focus on the historical and cultural highlights of the region, including Northern Norway during the Viking Era, fishing, mining, and World War II.

Some of the areas in Sweden we plan to visit include Kiruna; Nutti Sámi Siida in Jukkasjärvi, also the site of the famous Ice Hotel; and Ajtte, the Swedish Sámi and Mountain Musuem in Jokkmokk.

Some of the areas in Norway we plan to visit include the breath-taking Lofoten Islands, Tromso, “Paris of the North”; the Manndahlen Husflidslag in Samuelsberg, with opportunities to shop for Sámi handcrafts; the 2000-to-6200-year-old rock carving from the Stone Age at the Alta Museum; North Cape, “the northern most point of Europe;” a special Sámi experience in Masi; the Sámi National Museum and the Sámi Parliament in Karasjok; Tana Gull og Sølvsmie AS, silver workshop; and a picnic hosted by a local family on the Russian border in Pasvik Valley near Kirkenes.

**Harley Refsal** recently retired from four decades of teaching Norwegian language and Scandinavian culture courses at Luther College. A noted woodcarver, he has taught Scandinavian-style figure carving since the 1980s in Norway and the United States. He has led two Luther College January-term courses to Norway and was the guide for Vesterheim’s 2012 tour to Sámiland.

**Michelle Whitehill** is Vesterheim’s Coordinator of Tours to Norway. She has planned 11 tours and led tours to Norway in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Her organization and friendliness allow participants to sit back, relax, and enjoy the trip.
