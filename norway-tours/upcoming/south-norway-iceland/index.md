Price and itinerary will be announced in the fall of 2015.

During this incredible journey, experience the splendor of dramatic landscapes and the warm hearts of the people who live there. This tour will be a feast for the eyes as we explore the beautiful southern coastline of Norway, with waterfalls, mountains, and fjords, and the island country of Iceland, with geysers, glaciers, and volcanoes. Along the way, we’ll get to know the history and art of these areas, rich with tradition and culture.

The tour will begin in Oslo, the capital city of Norway, and travel through the region of Telemark, stopping in Kristiansand and Stavanger, and then along the Hardangerfjord to the picturesque city of Bergen. Some of the wonderful places we will visit include Heddal Stave Church; Hardangervidda National Park Centre in Skinnarbu; Norwegian Industrial Workers Museum in Vemork; Rauland Folk School; Vest Telemark Museum in Eidsborg; Byrkjedal; Posebyen (old town) and Fish Quay in Kristiansand; the Hardanger Folkemuseum; and Gamle Stavanger. We will sail on the replica of the Restauration, dine at the historic Utne Hotel, and visit the famous colorful wooden buildings of Bryggen, the old wharf of Bergen.

From there we will fly to “the land of fire and ice,” home to diverse geological features, hot springs, mountains, lava fields, amazing bird cliffs, moonlike landscapes, and fishing villages. In Iceland we will visit Reykjavík, the most northerly capital in the world. We will wander the cobblestone streets and colorful tin houses of Old Town and tour Hallgrímskirkja, a unique church in the middle of the city. We’ll travel alongside the Hekla volcano and visit the Hjálparfoss waterfall. Nearby, we will explore the Viking farm ruins at Stöng and visit three of Iceland’s most important spots—Gullfoss waterfall, Geyser hot springs, Þingvellir National Park, and Gullfoss “the golden falls.“ At Westman Islands we will explore bird cliffs, walk up the volcano crater, and visit “Pompeii of the North,” a volcanic excavation project.

Join us for this remarkable adventure!
