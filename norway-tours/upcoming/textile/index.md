=================
- [Itinerary](/norway-tours/upcoming/textile/itinerary/)

Vesterheim's seventh Textile Study Tour will focus on the textiles and traditions of both coastal Norway and the _Sámi_ people. Learn about weaving, knitting, sewing, and folk costumes while traveling through Norway's northernmost counties with stops in Tromsø, Samuelsberg, Alta, Máze, and Kautokeino.  There will be special opportunities to learn about _Sámi_ _duodji_ (functional items made beautiful) and to try your hand at several textile techniques. Experience _Syttende Mai_, Norwegian Constitution Day, and enjoy the celebration with parades, music, and beautiful national costumes.
