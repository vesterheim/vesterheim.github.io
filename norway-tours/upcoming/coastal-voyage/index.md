Vesterheim gives its special touch to the Hurtigruten’s classic Norwegian coastal voyage! With the help of tour guide, Knut Werner Hagen, every day of this incredible trip is filled with one-of-a-kind opportunities to explore Norway and see breathtaking scenery, both on land and at sea. Knut’s knowledge and respect for the beauty and history of his beloved Norway make this an unforgettable travel experience. Beginning in Bergen and ending in Kirkenes, this voyage takes participants through the calm, sheltered waters of Norway’s shores—close to the landscape, wildlife, and culture. Participants are guaranteed days and nights filled with majestic coastal Norway—awe-inspiring fjords, expansive sounds, snow-capped mountains, scenic skerries, and picturesque plains. The 34 ports of call, both historical and cosmopolitan, range from major cities to small fishing hamlets, and the stops vary from 45 minutes to 6 hours. Participants will pack their camera, binoculars, and sense of adventure for “The World’s Most Beautiful Voyage.”
