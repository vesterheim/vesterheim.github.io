Beginning in Bergen and ending in Kirkenes, this voyage will take you through the calm, sheltered waters of Norway’s shores—close to the landscape, wildlife, and culture. You are guaranteed days and nights filled with majestic coastal Norway—awe-inspiring fjords, expansive sounds, snow capped mountains, scenic skerries, and picturesque plains. The 34 ports of call, both historical and cosmopolitan, range from major cities to small fishing hamlets, and the stops vary from 45 minutes to 6 hours. Be sure to pack your camera, binoculars, and sense of adventure for “The World’s Most Beautiful Voyage.”
