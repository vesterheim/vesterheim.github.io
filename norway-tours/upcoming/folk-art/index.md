**June 13-29, 2014** <br />
**Tour Guide: Patti Goke** <br />
**Tour Leader: Darlene Fossum-Martin**

Immerse yourself in the traditional folk arts of rosemaling and woodcarving on a pilgrimage throughout nine counties in Norway. Meet and visit with the Norwegian folk artists who have shared so much of their talent with Vesterheim, including carvers Grete Rudningen, Rolf Taraldset, and Lars Stana, and painters Gunnar Bø, Tore Christiansen, Torunn Rød Farsund, Turid Helle Fatland, Unni Marie Lien, Johild Mæland, Tove Ness, and Eli Sælid. Also, visit the studio of Sigmund Aarseth and meet his lovely wife Ingeborg.

You‘ll enjoy special visits to private collections, museums, historic hotels, stave churches, and bygdetunets. You’ll get a firsthand look at various rosemaling styles and carving techniques. You will see both old traditions and contemporary designs that follow those old traditions. Be sure to bring your camera and sketchbook. The journey wouldn’t be complete without opportunities for hands-on artistic experiences, scholarly lectures, and evening discussions. This jam-packed folk-art study tour will keep you moving.

**Patti Goke**, an avid rosemaler, instructor, and Vesterheim Gold Medalist, has studied with many top Norwegian rosemaling instructors. She has also taught various styles of painting over the past 20 years and has traveled extensively throughout Norway seven times.

**Darlene Fossum-Martin**, Vesterheim’s Education Specialist, previously has been the museum’s group tour coordinator and special events coordinator. She led the Vesterheim Folk Art Tour to Voss in 2001 and Rørøs in 2003. Darlene loves Vesterheim’s folk-art program—the arts, artists, instructors, and students. She enjoys everyone’s enthusiasm for learning the art and its historical context. She attributes her strong Norwegian ties and traditions to the women in her family, her community, and years spent living, working, and traveling in Norway. She looks forward to sharing her love of the Norwegian countryside and its cultural richness while on this tour.
