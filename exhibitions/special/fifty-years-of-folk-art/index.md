Join us as we celebrate this major milestone of the groundbreaking Vesterheim Folk Art School! 

Learn about the history of Norwegian folk arts, explore how Vesterheim has helped preserve and promote them, and imagine what the future holds for Norwegian-American folk arts. The exhibition also features the works of artists who have taught and studied here.

Launched by previous director Marion Nelson, the Vesterheim Folk Art School began in 1967 just as traditional American and ethnic arts and crafts were becoming very popular. Visit the exhibition to discover more about this unique community and how it has supported creativity, cultural exchange, and growth for so many people over the last 50 years!

Support for this exhibition provided by the Iowa Arts Council, a division of the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs, and the National Endowment for the Arts; Veronna and John Capone; Ron Hovda; and additional support from Rockwell Collins, Jeff and Mary Ellen Anderson, Norsk Illinois Rosemalers Assoc., and Shirley and Earl Evenstad.
