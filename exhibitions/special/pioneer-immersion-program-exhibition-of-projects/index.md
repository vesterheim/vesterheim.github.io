**Exhibition of Projects:** May 16-22, 2016 <br />
**Open House:** To be announced.

The pioneer projects and journals that each student makes during the Pioneer Immersion Program form a special exhibition so that parents, friends, relatives, and the community can view the studentâ€™s work. Everyone is invited to view this fantastic show. The students are always so proud to see their work in a real museum exhibition.
