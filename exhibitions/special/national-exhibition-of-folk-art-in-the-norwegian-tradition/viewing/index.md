An annual show, competition, and sale!

Don't miss this opportunity to admire recent works of amazing folk art by contemporary artists from all over the country. Many of the pieces are for sale through silent auction—a great way to add to your folk-art collection, or to start one. The judged exhibition includes knifemaking, rosemaling, weaving, and woodworking—all in the Norwegian tradition. Every year brings new and exciting artwork, often blending traditional designs with contemporary creativity. 

Artists enter their pieces and are awarded Blue, Red, and White Ribbons representing points that accumulate over successive years toward a Gold Medal. Judges also present Honorable Mention and Best of Show Awards. Visitors are invited to vote for People’s Choice Awards. Ribbon winners and Gold Medalists are announced in conjunction with Nordic Fest, Decorah’s city-wide celebration of Norwegian heritage, which is held the last full weekend of July.

Vesterheim thanks Decorah Bank and Trust for sponsoring this exhibition!
