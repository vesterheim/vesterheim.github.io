Divisions
=========
Of the four divisions described below, artists should choose the one that best fits their piece. However, judges may redesignate the division of a piece for judging. If there are not sufficient numbers for a separation by division, the entries will be judged together.

{: type="I" }
1. Acanthus, dragon-style, _flatskurd_, baroque, and rococo.
2. Chip carving, _kolrosing_, and _svidekor_ (burnt design).
3. Figure carving, including three-dimensional and relief figures.
4. Open category, including ale hens and carved bowls, natural-form functional objects, and turned, bentwood, and stave containers.


Special Rules and Judging Standards
===================================
Entries should be executed in techniques and/or with stylistic characteristics common to Norwegian folk art. Items submitted for judging must be large enough to reveal the technical and aesthetic ability of the artist and not done under supervision. All carving and decorating must be done entirely by the artist entering. Entries in Divisions I and II may feature carving/decoration by the artist on a wooden form by another source. Entries in Divisions III and IV must be made and decorated solely by the artist entering. **The source of the design must be stated on the registration form.** Judges will rate entries on technique, design, and overall impact.
