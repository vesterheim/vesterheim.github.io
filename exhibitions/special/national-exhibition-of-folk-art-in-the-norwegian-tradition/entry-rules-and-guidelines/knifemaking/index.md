Special Rules And Judging Standards
===================================
Knives should be executed in techniques and/or with stylistic characteristics common to Norwegian knifemaking. All pieces, **except** **blades**, must be made solely by the entering artist and not done under supervision. **The materials used for the handle and sheath must be stated on the registration form.** Judges will rate entries on functional and aesthetic values: technique and design of the knife, sheath, and overall impression.
