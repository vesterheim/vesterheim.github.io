Divisions
=========
Of the two divisions described below, weavers should choose the one that best fits their piece. However, judges may redesignate the division of a piece for judging. If there are not sufficient numbers for a separation by division, the entries will be judged together.

### I. Traditional
{: .heading--mixed-case }

Must follow the historical tradition in technique, colors, and materials. Entries may be adaptations of old pieces.

### II. Contemporary
{: .heading--mixed-case }

Should be a contemporary departure from the historical in technique or colors or materials. Some elements should still identify the piece as being within the tradition.

Typical Norwegian weaving techniques include:

* Plain weaves: Warp-faced, weft-faced, 50/50 weaves; striped and two-shuttle (_kjerringtenner, harrender, lynild,_ etc.); picture tapestry (_billedvev_) and geometric tapestry (_rutevev_).
* Float weaves: Straight, diamond or point twill; boundweave (_krokbragd_), bound rosepath, _danskbrogd_; satin and damask weaves.
* Compound weaves: Woven pile (_rya, flossa_); overshot with accidentals (halvdreiel); overshot without accidentals (_tavlebragd, skillbragd,_ _telemarksvev_); _vestfoldsmett_; double binding; doubleweave.
* Tablet and other band weaves.

## Special Rules and Judging Standards

Weavings must be the artistâ€™s original design, and not done under supervision. Judges will rate weavings on overall impact, design, and weaving technique. They will look at the whole piece and consider the appropriateness of design, materials, and finishing. **Important: The intended function of the piece must be stated on the registration form.** Judges will examine the back as well as the front, so backings must be open in one section. Award-winning entries will demonstrate excellence in technical skills, show an understanding of both aesthetic and functional considerations, and express personal creativity within the long and rich tradition of Norwegian weaving.
