Special Rules And Judging Standards
===================================
The decorations must be on wood. They must be original and not done under supervision. The patterns may, however, be inspired by another work. They should reveal the stylistic characteristics of rural Norwegian painting from about 1700 to 1875. The rosemaling must cover an area of at least 8 inches in diameter and must contain enough decoration to reveal the artistâ€™s technical skill and ability in design. **The regional style in which the piece was painted must be indicated on the registration form.** Judges will rate entries on color, design, technique, and overall impact. Typically, the number of ribbons awarded is equivalent to 10% of competing entries. Please attach a hanging device to the back of objects that can be hung, e.g., plates, hanging cupboards, etc. Vesterheim reserves the right to attach a hanging device to any plate or flat object not provided with one.
