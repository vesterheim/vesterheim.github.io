Vesterheim’s collections include some remarkable pieces that are not recently on display. We've brought some of them out of storage for a limited time in the exhibition _Favorite Things_. The exhibition highlights a wide-range of objects, including landscape paintings by Christian Midjo, a fiddle with red devils painted around the edge, a local Decorah-area family heirloom _bunad_ (Norwegian costume), and real oak leaves with intricate etchings. Which will be your favorite?

Like most museums, Vesterheim has many more objects than can be displayed at one given time. When visitors come to the museum, they see about ten percent of the vast collections of over 24,000 objects. The museum’s three storage facilities house the rest of the collections.

The popular picks in _Favorite Things_ were selected by museum staff and visitors. Many of the objects were chosen for their beauty, but many were also chosen for their fantastic history or quirky story.

Last August 50 items were nominated by the public as worthy of being part of the exhibition. Everyone was invited to rate the items online and the top 15 items from this group are in the exhibition. Vesterheim staff were also asked to choose their favorite artifact and why they love the piece.

“My office is located in small object storage, so I’m constantly surrounded by Vesterheim’s beautiful objects,” Alison Dwyer, Vesterheim Collections Manager and curator of the exhibition, said. “Now you get to experience some of these amazing objects, too,” she continued.

The exhibition is sponsored by Jon and Mary Hart with additional support from Farmers and Merchants Savings Bank.
