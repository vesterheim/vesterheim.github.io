“Mid-Century Modern” is the hot buzzword in today’s retro-design trend. Vesterheim has turned its spotlight on Norway’s contributions to mid-century design in the exhibition, _Scandinavian Modern Design: Norwegian Enamel_.

This exhibition focuses on Norwegian enamel design and enamel production (technology, innovation, and business). Artistic and technical innovations in enamel work were Norway’s greatest, though least remembered, contributions to the Scandinavian Modern Design movement of the mid-twentieth century.

The exhibition features Grete Prytz Kittelsen, known as the “Queen of Scandinavian Design,” through her work for the firms Tostrup and Cathrineholm. With good design, functional forms, inexpensive materials, and efficient manufacturing, especially through her partnership with Cathrineholm, she brought Norwegian enamel design into the forefront in both Scandinavia and the United States.

The exhibition showcases enamel jewelry, cookware, and tableware from Vesterheim’s collection and from individuals. The guest curator for the exhibition is Kate Martinson, Emeritus Professor of Art at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. Exhibition programing will include gallery talks, presentations, and receptions.

Upcoming lectures in connection with the exhibition include:
