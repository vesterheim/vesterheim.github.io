For centuries, alcoholic beverages have played a role in spirited Scandinavian celebrations, inspiring consummate folk art and raising the ire of Temperance and religious leaders. This exciting traveling exhibition curated by the Museum of Danish America shares the history and traditions of drinking culture in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, and how those traditions carried into the U.S. with immigrants. The exhibit focuses on beer and aquavit—the traditional booze of Scandinavia that means “the water of life.”

Scandinavians have brewed beer for over 1,500 years. In pre-Christian times, the Norse god Odin was credited with teaching humans how to brew beer, and drinking beer was often involved in worship and as offering to the deities. Beer was part of battle victory celebrations and sometimes drinking challenges. In the 1500s, distilled liquor became known through Scandinavia as a medical cure-all. Early distilling efforts often produced awful flavors, so herbs and other plants were used to improve the taste—creating what is now known as aquavit. 

The main flavor of aquavit, according to the European Union, should be caraway or dill, and the minimum alcohol by volume has to be 37.5%. The taste of this Scandinavian spirit has been described as “rye bread in liquid form"—an unsurprising flavor profile since rye bread is a staple in Nordic diets. Carlsberg is a popular brand, though microbrewing is just as, if not more, popular in Scandinavia as it is in the U.S. These drinking traditions offer one way for Scandinavian Americans to connect to their heritage. 

There will be an opening reception on September 9, 2016, which will include presentations by Tova Brandt, curator at the Museum of Danish America, and Christer Andre Olsen, from the Norwegian company Arcus, distributer of Aalborg and Linie Aquavits. More information coming soon!

Also in conjunction with the exhibition, Lexi from the Old Ballard Liquor Company in Seattle, Washington, will teach two workshops about aquavit in October. 

Vesterheim's presentation of this exhibition is sponsored by Dennis Johnson.
