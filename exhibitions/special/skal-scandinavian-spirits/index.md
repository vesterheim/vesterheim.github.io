For centuries, alcoholic beverages have played a role in spirited Scandinavian celebrations, inspiring consummate folk art and raising the ire of Temperance and religious leaders. This exciting traveling exhibition curated by the Museum of Danish America shares the history and traditions of drinking culture in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, and how those traditions carried into the U.S. with immigrants. The exhibit focuses on beer and aquavit—the traditional booze of Scandinavia that means “the water of life.”

Scandinavians have brewed beer for over 1,500 years. In pre-Christian times, the Norse god Odin was credited with teaching humans how to brew beer, and drinking beer was often involved in worship and as offering to the deities. Beer was part of battle victory celebrations and sometimes drinking challenges. In the 1500s, distilled liquor became known through Scandinavia as a medical cure-all. Early distilling efforts often produced awful flavors, so herbs and other plants were used to improve the taste—creating what is now known as aquavit. 

The main flavor of aquavit, according to the European Union, should be caraway or dill, and the minimum alcohol by volume has to be 37.5%. The taste of this Scandinavian spirit has been described as “rye bread in liquid form"—an unsurprising flavor profile since rye bread is a staple in Nordic diets. Aquavit pairs well with traditional Scandinavian cuisine like herring and other delights of the sea, such as crawfish and all manners of prepared salmon. A cold beer chaser is common during Scandinavian dining events like those during Midsummer and Christmas.Carlsberg is a popular brand, though microbrewing is just as, if not more, popular in Scandinavia as it is in the U.S. These drinking traditions offer one way for Scandinavian Americans to connect to their heritage. 

Here's a teaser for some of the fun events coming this fall. On September 9 Vesterheim members are in for a special treat, an evening of SKÅL at a members-only opening! The evening will begin with a presentation on the historic and cultural significance of Scandinavian spirits, followed by a rousing aquavit tasting and food pairing, guided by Christer Andre Olsen, from the Norwegian company Arcus, distributor of Aalborg and Linie Aquavits. After the tasting, Tova Brandt, curator at the Museum of Danish America, who created this exhibition, will take members on small group tours of the show, sharing behind-the-scenes stories about the making of _Skål!_ 

The community is invited to an exhibition opening reception on June 10. This event includes a free public aquavit tasting with Christer Andre Olsen, from the Norwegian company Arcus, distributor of Aalborg and Linie Aquavits, and gallery talks by Tova Brandt, curator at the Museum of Danish America, who created this special exhibition. 

Also, Lexi from the Old Ballard Liquor Company in Seattle, Washington, will teach two workshops about aquavit in October. 

More specific information about these and other Skål events will be announced soon.

Vesterheim’s presentation of this exhibition is sponsored by Dennis Johnson, The Edward Jones Investment Offices of Dick Cuvelier and Troy Whitehill, and Dennis Larson.
