This exhibition is a special installation of a monumental artwork—a flag sculpture—made by Ian Ward Garlant of Hatlestrand, Norway, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Norwegian constitution. The artwork illustrates the principles that the occasion embodies—love, mutual acceptance, and compassion.

Born in 1962 to an English father and Norwegian mother, Garlant left an illustrious career in London’s top fashion houses to dedicate his life to making art full time on Norway’s Hardanger fjord. Working with and within the landscape, Garlant’s creative process involves burning, bathing, and scraping pre-used wood, asphalt, and sand of the fjord to create new sculptural interpretations of ancient earthly monuments. Together with local craftsmen, Garlant has found new ways to use readily available materials, some traditional and others high tech. Utilizing an array of quotations, words, symbols, and patterns culled from both the ancient and the modern, the pieces in this exhibition reflect mankind's continued hopes and wishes to create the best of all possible worlds—a testament to love.

Stylistic choices for Garlant’s work borrow from Viking runes found in Norway, kufic text from Arabia, horyig seal script from Tibet, and I-Ching hexagrams from China. These methods of writing have crossed over at various points in time: runic graffiti is to be found in the Church of Hagai Sophia in Constantinople, kufic text is to be found on silver coins in Viking graves, and oriental seals and symbols are distributed all along the trades routes used by Vikings, Arabs, and Mongol tribes alike, connecting Northern Europe to the Far East. Garlant combines these together to form a 'tapestry' illustrating a common message that transcends language.

This exhibition was created in partnership with American Swedish Institute.
