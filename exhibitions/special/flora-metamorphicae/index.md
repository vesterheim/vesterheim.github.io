_Colorful flowers are beautiful and beauty draws attention._<br />
—Jorunn Veiteberg, PhD, Art Historian

Come experience _Flora Metamorphicae_, thousands of beautiful and colorful ceramic flowers artfully configured for exhibition at Vesterheim Museum. This truly stunning exhibition is on view in the museum’s Asbjørnsen Gallery and is sponsored by The Iowa Arts Council, Sons of Norway Foundation, Sons of Norway Valdres Lodge in Decorah, Joseph Keiger, and Dan Huebner.

_Flora Metamorphicae_ is a remarkable project created by six contemporary Norwegian artists—Kari Aasen, Lipa Dalén, Siri Haaskjkold, Bjørg Hougen, Audhild Rypdal, and Eli Veim. All are educated ceramacists based in the Bergen, Norway, region. While they have individual careers as artists, they have been able to use their skills in ceramic techniques and their professional knowledge of art to create a beautiful but changing collective work of art.

Just as each of the 4,000 flowers is unique, each installation of _Flora Metamorphicae_ is unique, depending upon the setting. Each installation is created by at least two of the artists, who take inspiration for the configuration from the space and potential audiences. Since 2003, the group of artists has had installations around the world, both indoors and outdoors, including Sweden, Finland, Latvia, France, The Netherlands, and South Korea. Vesterheim Museum is one of the first venues for _Flora Metamorphicae_ in the United States.

While the flowers themselves and the installations are very modern, the artists’ techniques and inspirations are rooted in traditions. Flowers have long been a popular decoration for ceramics, although this is been primarily as painted decoration. At the porcelain factories, like Norway’s Porsgrunn, that were established in Europe during the fifteenth century, it became fashionable to use miniature flowers as decoration. Evidence of this can be seen in the beautiful porcelain plates, cups, and tureens in Vesterheim’s collection. It was, in fact, a book of photos of porcelain from the Meissen factory that inspired the idea for creating _Flora Metamorphicae._

The flowers of _Flora Metamorphicae_ may also be seen as challenge to tradition. According to art historian Mai Lahn-Johannessen, _Flora Metamorphicae_ retains the basic elements of clay, flowers, and their inherent symbolism; however, the artists have transformed these components to undergo a transformation. The only requirements the artists had were that each flower needed to be handmade and no larger than two handfuls of clay. The flowers did not need to be similar to natural flowers, but could grow from imagination.

To paraphrase the artist Henri Matisse, in Vesterheim’s collection there are always flowers for those who want to see them, but be sure not to miss this unique and visually spectacular opportunity to walk among them in _Flora Metamorphicae._
