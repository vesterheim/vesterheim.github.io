Lila Nelson, Vesterheim’s first Textile Curator, was an accomplished textile artist in her own right. This retrospective exhibition shows how she began by mastering traditional Norwegian weaving techniques, subsequently using them in fresh and contemporary ways. Later in life she focused on tapestry weaving, which allowed her greater personal and political expression.

She and her late husband Marion Nelson are credited with transforming Vesterheim into the premier ethnic museum that it is today. In the mid-1960s, they were hired to catalog the collection of art, pottery, furniture, and other artifacts at the museum, then affiliated with Luther College. When Vesterheim became an independent nonprofit in 1965, Lila became the museum’s Textile Curator and Marion Nelson the museum’s Executive Director.

Lila, who passed away on May 26, 2015, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at age 93, was an exceptional woman who was active in the Weavers Guild of Minnesota for decades, taught classes and led tours to Norway, and created an impressive body of weaving. She and Marion were members of Valhalla Society, Vesterheim's planned giving program. 

This exhibition includes 76 pieces from Vesterheim's collection and private collections.

The exhibition is sponsored by Ella Ager Fossum, Jon and Mary Hart, Darold and Carol Oversvee Johnson, Steve and Barb Johnson, Kate Martinson, Irene Navarre, and Sonja Peterson.
