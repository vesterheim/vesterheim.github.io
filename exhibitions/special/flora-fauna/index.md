_Flora and Fauna in Norwegian Folk Art_ is currently on display on the second floor of the Museum's Main Building. The display celebrates both the use of natural materials in Norwegian folk-art and the way artists portrayed flowers and animals in their work. The display includes various traditional Norwegian folk-art pieces, as well as contemporary examples of textiles and embroidery, rosemaling, and acanthus and chip carving. 

Pieces in the Norwegian folk-art tradition are created in a variety of natural materials, including wood, root, wool, steel, silver, and paint. Many of these pieces clearly portray flora and fauna. The oldest discipline, woodcarving, has influences from the acanthus plant, and rosemaling takes its main inspiration from both the acanthus plant and flowers. Textiles, in contrast, often portray scenes of fauna and mythology, as well as flora. Fauna in folk art can be seen in the form of lions, eagles, dragons, horses, or even serpents. 

Included in the display is a wedding rug from 1675 covered with both imaginative and realistic flowers, showing the artistic liberties and imagination of the artist. Moved from its home on the third floor of the Main Building is a large trunk from 1787, signifying the importance of fauna, particularly horses, in Norwegian folk art. Many other unique objects are included in the display, including an embroidered _bunad,_ panels with rosemaling, an acanthus-carved clock, and several examples of weaving.
