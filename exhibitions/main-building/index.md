Step inside Vesterheim’s Main Building to discover four floors filled with stories of identity, beauty, and faith. The lives of the people who settled our nation where often as colorful as their folk art and their stories speak through the objects they left behind. You’ll find a cabin made from a single tree, elaborate costumes, intricately carved butter molds, colorful paintings, silver wedding crowns, woven tapestries, and even a boat that sailed the Atlantic Ocean.

Vesterheim’s Main Building includes home life in nineteenth-century Norway, a 25-foot wooden sailboat _TradeWind,_ an immigrant log house from 1853, and thousands of examples of Norwegian and Norwegian-American materials. You will enjoy displays of folk art that range from centuries-old woodcarving to beautiful contemporary rosemaling (decorative painting). Learn about Norwegian traditions and follow the immigrant story to see how Norwegian-Americans sustained and shared their heritage in their _vesterheim_, their “western home.”
