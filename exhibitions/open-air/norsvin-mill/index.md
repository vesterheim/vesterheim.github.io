This small grist mill reflects the subsistence economy that drove many to emigrate from Norway. A vertical shaft and horizontal waterwheel allowed efficient use of a small mountain stream to grind grain. Knut Norsvin had heard there were no stones in America, so he brought the millstones when he emigrated. His grandson found the mill itself at the Kongslien farm in Valdres, Norway, and had it shipped to America to house the millstones.
