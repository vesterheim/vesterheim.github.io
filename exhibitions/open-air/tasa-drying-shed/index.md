This building is an example of special-use buildings on Norwegian farms, which allowed for self-sufficiency in the relative isolation imposed by the geography of Norway. Like several other buildings at Vesterheim, this is an American-made building with Norwegian design and function, but constructed in a new way. It was used for brewing and for drying grain and could also serve as a bath house. Built by Knut Thompson Tasa primarily for harvest and Christmas brewing, the oven in the shed would be fired to warm water-soaked barley until it sprouted, after which the brewing would take place.
