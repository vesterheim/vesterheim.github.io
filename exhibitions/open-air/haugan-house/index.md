This house is one of two similar log homes from rural Decorah now in the Open Air Division. Hans and Anna Haugan lived here for at least twenty years. They were in their fifties when they left Norway, whereas most immigrants were much younger. Like many immigrants, however, they were of the _husmann_, or tenant farmer, class. It is significant that in America, they owned their home and farm.
