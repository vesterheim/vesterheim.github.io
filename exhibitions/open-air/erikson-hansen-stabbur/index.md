This building type, a storehouse placed on pedestals to deter pests, was a symbol of wealth in Norway. Having surplus agricultural products to store defined success and survival. This is a rare example because they were seldom found on Norwegian-American farms. However, the _stabbur_-style of storehouse was common on more substantial Norwegian farms and in fact announced oneâ€™s status.
