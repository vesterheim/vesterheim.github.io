Vesterheim’s Open Air Division is a collection of 12 historic buildings located near the Main Building.

The Open Air Division is open from May 1 to October 31, and guided tours of the Open Air Division occur daily at 1:30 p.m., included with your admission purchase. (These tours are subject to the availability of guides and may occasionally take place at different times or, on rare occasions, be canceled. Please confirm tour departure place and time with a desk attendant upon your arrival at Vesterheim.)

If you aren’t able to take the guided tour, it is worth wandering the grounds and reading the signs outside each building.
