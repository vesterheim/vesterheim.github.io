Originally located on the west side of Decorah, this house is a rare example of stovewood construction, using short lengths of wood and mortar. This system originated in the mid-1800s, apparently in Canada. Norwegian immigrants who returned to Norway introduced the construction technique around 1900 in Norway. With exterior siding, a parlor, and closets, this house exemplified fashionable town living. Vesterheim acquired it because of its unique architectureâ€”it is the only example known to exist in Iowa. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
