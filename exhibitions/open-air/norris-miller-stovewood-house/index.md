Originally located on the west side of Decorah, this house is a rare example of stovewood construction, using short lengths of wood and mortar. This system originated in the mid-1800s, apparently in Canada. Norwegian immigrants who returned to Norway introduced the construction technique around 1900 in Norway. With exterior siding, a parlor, and closets, this house exemplified fashionable town living. Vesterheim acquired it because of its unique architecture—it is the only example known to exist in Iowa. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
