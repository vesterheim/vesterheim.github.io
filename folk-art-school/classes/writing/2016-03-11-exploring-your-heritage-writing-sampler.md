Do you cherish family stories and want to preserve them? Have you always wanted to try creative writing, or to take your writing to a deeper level? Are you curious about your ancestors—known or unknown—and looking to discover more? This workshop will introduce you to several types of writing, including poetry, memoir, fiction, and creative non-fiction. You will enjoy a variety of short writing activities designed to help capture memories or explore what interests you most about your unique family, ethnic group, or community heritage. Inspired by Vesterheim’s rich collections, or whatever personal memories or heirlooms you wish to explore, you’ll leave with drafts of several poems, character sketches, essays, or short stories.
