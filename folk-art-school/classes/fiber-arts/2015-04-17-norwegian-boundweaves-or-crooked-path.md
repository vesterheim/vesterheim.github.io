Weft-faced pattern weaves, or boundweaves, can be woven on two or more harnesses, and are rich in design possibilities. Boundweaves are woven on either a cotton or linen warp that is completely covered by a tightly packed wool weft. Weft-faced textiles are suitable for table runners, rugs, coverlets, or wall hangings. This class will focus on _krokbragd_, a three-shaft point twill and _rosebragd_, a boundweave on a four-harness rosepath threading. The threading and treadling for this weaving structure are simple and allow the weaver great freedom to explore color and design.
