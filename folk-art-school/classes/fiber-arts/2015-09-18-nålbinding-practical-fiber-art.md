Scandinavians have used the ancient _nålbinding_ technique for hundreds of years to make mittens, strainers, stockings, and a multitude of other useful items. It fits perfectly into contemporary fashion and household uses and its simplicity and portability make it wonderful. Using a single-eyed needle, you will make a pouch, mittens, and various other small items as time permits. Most objects will be made of wool and finished by hand with a traditional fulling treatment.
