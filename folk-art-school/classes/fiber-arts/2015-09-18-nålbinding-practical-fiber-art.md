Years before knitting was developed, _nålbinding_ was the primary method of making shaped fabric by the ancestors of Western cultures. It pre-dates the Viking era and has been found in areas all over the world. The single-eyed needle, thread, and looped structure of _nålbinding_ create a fabric sturdier than knitted fabric, and it is perfect for making mittens, strainers, purses, stockings, and a multitude of other useful items. 

We still have this ancient technique, often called 'knotless netting,' because people continued to practice it in remote areas of Scandinavia well into the twentieth century as part of an unbroken oral textile tradition. _Nålbinding_ has been consistently transmitted person-to-person for thousands of years and the process is best shown directly.

_Nålbinding_ fits wonderfully into contemporary fashion and household uses. Its simplicity and portability make it a useful technique to know. In this class, you will use a single-eyed needle to make a pouch, mittens, and various other small items as time permits. Most objects will be made of wool and finished by hand with a traditional fulling treatment. 

Kathleen Ernst wrote about her experience studying _nålbinding_ with Kate Martinson at Vesterheim. Find the story [here.](https://sitesandstories.wordpress.com/2013/03/02/nalbinding-part-1-an-ancient-technique/)
