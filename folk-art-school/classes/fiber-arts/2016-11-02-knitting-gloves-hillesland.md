Vesterheim has several unique sets of traditional Norwegian gloves and we’ll knit a pair like one of them. Instead of the traditional ribbing, this one has a pretty border, which indicates they were made for a woman. The glove has a thumb gusset, common for Norwegian gloves and mittens, and the back of the hand has a different design from the palm. The design for the fingers is a continuation of the hand design, and each finger matches beautifully. We will also look at hand anatomy, so future mittens and gloves can be made with a good fit.
