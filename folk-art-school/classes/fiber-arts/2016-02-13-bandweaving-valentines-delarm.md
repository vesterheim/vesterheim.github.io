_Visit Decorah with a partner or friend for a fun weekend, each learning a different folk art. The weaver of the couple will take a class in how to weave elaborate patterns on a band loom (also called tape loom or rigid heddle), while the carver will take a class in how to carve a one-piece band loom and shuttle. Band looms were traditionally carved as sweetheart gifts, so at the end of the weekend, the loom can be presented to the weaver for Valentine’s Day. You can share this experience at Vesterheim and in future creations together! See the woodworking section for info about the carving class [here](/folk-art-school/classes/woodworking/2016-02-13-band-loom-carving-valentines-abrahamson/)._

Learn to set up and weave on a basic band loom. We’ll start off with measuring, warping, and weaving basic strips. Once the strip of plain weave has been mastered, you will move on to the advanced pick-up patterns that decorate costumes, headbands, bag straps, and more. Learn how to design and set up your own patterns and drafts. Weavers will leave the class with strips of woven tapes or bands, elaborate bookmarks, headbands or ribbons, a back strap belt, and a booklet of patterns and blank charts.
