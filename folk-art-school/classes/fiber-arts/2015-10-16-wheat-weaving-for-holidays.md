In many of the Nordic countries, wheat is braided into different shapes and patterns for decorating houses and trees at Christmas. Learn about the basic _hvetevefting_ (wheat weaving) materials, straw preparation, and the traditional art of wheat-weaving techniques. Youâ€™ll be able to make a collection of ornaments and wall hangings just in time for the holidays.
