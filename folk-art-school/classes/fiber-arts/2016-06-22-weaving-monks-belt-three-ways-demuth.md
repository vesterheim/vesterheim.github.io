Monk’s Belt is a two-block weave that can be woven using several different weaving structures. It can be woven as an overshot, where the pattern is created using weft floats. In Threaded or Turned Monk’s Belt, the pattern is created using warp floats. Both of these structures produce a lighter-weight textile that is appropriate for curtains, runners, and wall hangings. Monk’s Belt can also be woven as a weft-faced boundweave, a technique that results in a heavier textile that is appropriate for pillows, cushion covers, and rugs. You will have the opportunity to weave samples of each of these weaving structures in class.
