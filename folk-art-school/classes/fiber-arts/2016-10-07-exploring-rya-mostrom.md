In this class, you will sample a variety of Nordic rya patterns and techniques. Some of these will be taken from _rya_ in the Vesterheim collection, including coverlets that have pile on one side and beautiful patterns on the other where no knots show. You will weave several of these designs, including houndstooth, goose eye, and rosepath. You will also make a sample of a goose eye design where the knots show on the non-pile side and form part of the pattern. You will weave _rya_ with pile on both sides and _rya_ combined with _krokbragd_ style, plus you will explore some variations of _rya_ weaving, including _flossa_, and a knot used during Viking times to insulate clothing and blankets. This will be a round robin class and you will go home with many samples and knowledge to use as inspiration for planning your own _rya_ project.
