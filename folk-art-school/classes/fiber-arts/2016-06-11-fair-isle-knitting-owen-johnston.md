This knitting style is named after Fair Isle, part of the Shetland Islands. Fair Isle knitting involves carrying only two colors per row, but the combination can range from dark to light and bright to subtle. Pattern repeats are somewhat similar, but distinctive from their Nordic cousins. The islands have strong cultural ties with the Nordic countries—Norway, and Faeroe in particular. You’ll begin by designing and knitting a small project as a stepping stone into the stranded style called “Fair Isle,” and you’ll make a sample while practicing knitting in the round and finishing techniques for seamless construction. Then you’ll begin a finished piece, such as a decorative mat, pin cushion, small pouch, headband, egg cozy, gloves, or mittens. You’ll get to try using a traditional Shetland knitting belt. The materials for this class will be the product of the previous spinning class, plus extra natural colored yarns—all from Shetland sheep. Students are invited to participate in each class separately, or join in for the whole adventure.
