_Nålbinding_ is a fabric creation technique predating both knitting and crocheting. Scandinavians have used this ancient technique for hundreds of years to make mittens, strainers, stockings, and more. It fits perfectly into contemporary fashion and household uses. Its simplicity makes it easy to take with you anywhere. Using a single-eyed needle, you will make a pouch, mittens, and other items as time permits. Most objects will be made of wool and finished by hand with a traditional fulling treatment. 

Kathleen Ernst wrote about her experience studying _nålbinding_ with Kate Martinson at Vesterheim. Find the story [here.](https://sitesandstories.wordpress.com/2013/03/02/nalbinding-part-1-an-ancient-technique/)
