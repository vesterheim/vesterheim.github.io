Learn to set up and weave on a basic band loom. We’ll start off with measuring, warping, and weaving basic strips. Once the strip of plain weave has been mastered, you will move on to the advanced pick-up patterns that decorate costumes, headbands, bag straps, and more. Learn how to design and set up your own patterns and drafts. Weavers will leave the class with strips of woven tapes or bands, elaborate bookmarks, headbands or ribbons, a back strap belt, and a booklet of patterns and blank charts.
