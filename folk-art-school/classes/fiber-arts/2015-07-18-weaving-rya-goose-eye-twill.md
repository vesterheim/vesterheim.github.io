Norwegian *ryer* were used for coverlets and provided protection and warmth at sea for centuries. Borrowing from a *rya* coverlet design in the Vesterheim collection, you will weave *rya* on a goose-eye twill  background. The *rya* knots will not show on the non-pile side. Your weaving will be appropriate for a wall hanging or bench cover.
