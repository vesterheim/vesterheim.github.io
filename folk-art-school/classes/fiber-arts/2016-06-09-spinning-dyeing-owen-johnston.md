Start with an array of Shetland sheep colors combined with a dye pot or two, and we’ll card, blend, and spin to produce a vast array of colored yarns characteristic of beautiful Fair Isle knits. Use white and natural fleece colors for shades with dye pots of common and historic renewable natural dye sources. Combine colors to see the endless variety of  heather mixes achievable. Spin/ply your carded wools and prepare to design and knit a small project as a stepping stone into the stranded knitting style called “Fair Isle.” Our topics will include: cultural details, sorting fleece, working with natural sheep colors, picking, hand and drum carding, color blending, wheel adjustments, plying, simple natural dyepots, and lessons on consistency.
