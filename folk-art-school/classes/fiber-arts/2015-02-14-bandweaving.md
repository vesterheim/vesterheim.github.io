Visit Decorah with a partner or friend, to learn about traditional European band loom carving and weaving! These two classes, one in weaving and one in woodcarving, make for a fun weekend together. Weavers will learn how to weave elaborate patterns on a band loom (also called tape loom or rigid heddle), while carvers will learn how to carve a one-piece band loom and shuttle. Band looms were traditionally carved and used as sweetheart gifts, so at the end of the weekend, the loom will be presented to the weaver for Valentine’s Day. This is a class two people can share, at Vesterheim and in future creations together!

The weavers will learn to set up and weave on a basic band loom. Measuring, warping, and weaving basic strips will start off the class. Once the strip of plain weave has been mastered, you will quickly move on to the advanced pick-up patterns that decorate costumes, headbands, bag straps, and more. Learn how to design and set up your own pattern and drafts. Weavers will leave the class with strips of woven tapes or bands, elaborate bookmarks, headbands or ribbons, a back strap belt, and a booklet of patterns and blank charts. There will be a materials fee.
