Custom-make your own Norwegian sweater! In class you will study several traditional models on display in the exhibition _From Underwear to Everywhere: Norwegian Sweaters_ and then pick your favorite style. Arnhild will give a wide selection of pattern options to choose from, or you can come up with your own pattern designs to make the sweater uniquely yours. You will learn how to take measurements, make a gauge swatch, measure the gauge, and put all this information together in order to make a garment that fits the way you want. You will learn how to do the calculations according to measurements and gauge, and Arnhild will discuss the weight options of traditional wool yarn.
