Each area of Norway has a different *bunad* (national costume) design. This class is for anyone who wishes to construct their own authentic formal or everyday *bunad*, or an authentic purse, cap, shawl, belt, or blouse to complete the costume. Sue will have many different fabrics, colors, and ideas to help you start or complete a *bunad* or accessory. 

Class will be held at Luther College Baker Commons with overnight accommodations available. Reserve rooms with Darlene Fossum-Martin.
