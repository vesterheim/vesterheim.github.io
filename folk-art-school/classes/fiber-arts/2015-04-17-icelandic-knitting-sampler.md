Join Icelandic knitting expert and designer Hélène Magnússon as she shares her passion for Iceland’s rich knitting heritage.

Lesson 1
--------
Knit a miniature Icelandic *lopapeysa* sweater. Learn to combine sleeves and body, read color charts, Icelandic bind-off, and close underarms.

Lesson 2
--------
Learn to *steek* (cut extra stitches) a garment knit in the round. Knitters will see different ways to finish the steeks once they are cut.

Lesson 3
--------
While knitting a doll-sized triangular shawl with typical lace motifs in a variety of colors, learn garter stitch tab cast on, deciphering spider lace, and blocking tips. 

Lesson 4
--------
Knit a small shoe insert that will allow you to learn Icelandic *intarsia* techniques.

Lesson 5
---------
Learn *slynging*, a technique few women still know. In Northern Iceland, some shoe inserts were knitted in the round in stranded knitting, cut in two, lined, and then edged with a band.
