Nothing expresses tradition like food â€” the smell, the taste, the memory of family and community that it inspires. Keep those traditions alive by learning to make your favorites, or create a new tradition with something different. From lefse to cheese to beer, Vesterheim's food classes will make you smile.

We're working hard scheduling our 2016 classes... please check back soon!
