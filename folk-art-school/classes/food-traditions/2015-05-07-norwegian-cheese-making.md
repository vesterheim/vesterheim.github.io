“Smile and say cheese” is Gary’s motto. Ask anyone who has visited Norway to name a well-known Norwegian food and they will smile and say cheese. In this hands-on, church-basement cheesemaking experience, Gary will cover the basic equipment, ingredients, and procedures to make artisan cheese at home. After taking this class, you will have the knowledge to prepare almost every kind of cheese. During class, students will prepare and taste Norwegian Nokkelost, Norvegia, Pultost, Snofrisk, and Jarlsberg.
