Through demonstration and hands-on experience, learn to prepare the ever popular potato _lefse,_ using time-proven techniques. We will also prepare dessert _lefse,_ which is often found on many coffee tables in Norway. This class will provide instruction in three variations of _flatbrød_—one of Norway’s most traditional foods.
