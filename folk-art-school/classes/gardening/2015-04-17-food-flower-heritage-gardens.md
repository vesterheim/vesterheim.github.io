Many people’s earliest memories include raising gardens and livestock. Join Marty as she shows you how to bring back some of these memories to share with family and friends, or just to soothe your soul. You’ll learn information about seed starting, saving, and propagation for flowers that have been grown in the Midwest for generations. Fill your whole yard or a small container, include vegetables and herbs, or create a haven for butterflies. Marty will cover freezing, drying, and storing vegetables, fruits, and herbs. Plus she’ll give information about preserving family garden history. Darlene will demonstrate time-honored recipes. Go home with the skills and knowledge needed to plan a garden just right for you.
