Give someone special a Sámi-inspired bracelet!

The Sámi are the indigenous people of the far north in Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula of Russia. In addition to fishing and farming, reindeer husbandry has been an important part of their livelihood. Sámi handwork features both materials and design inspiration from their native lands. 

Students in this class will make a Sámi-inspired leather bracelet with pewter thread, using traditional Sámi design, and a reindeer-antler button. The pewter thread is nickel free and contains 4% silver. You will leave the class with one fully completed project. The technique involves very close handwork.
