With simple tools and wire of various gauges and materials, students will learn the basic techniques of wirework and explore creative applications of wire working. During class, we will make a variety of useful and beautiful household objects, including hooks, candlesticks, bowls, jewelry, and trivets. Faith is excited to introduce this relatively unknown craft.
