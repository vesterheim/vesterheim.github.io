Join the Swedish renaissance of _luffarslöjd._ Make a wide variety of household and decorative items, including hooks, candlesticks, bowls, jewelry, and trivets, with simple tools and inexpensive wire. This art form was widely practiced by Swedish vagabonds during the early twentieth century and now luffarslöjd items are for sale at every market and craft shop in Sweden. Faith Clover will show you how to make the many traditional _luffarslöjd_ items, but there are no rules to the craft, and with these simple techniques, your designs and intricacies are limited only by your imagination. Faith is excited to introduce this relatively unknown craft.
