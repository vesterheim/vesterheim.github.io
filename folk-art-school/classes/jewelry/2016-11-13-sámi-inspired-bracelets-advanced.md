Give someone special a Sámi-inspired bracelet!
 
The Sámi are the indigenous people of the far north in Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula of Russia. In addition to fishing and farming, reindeer husbandry has been an important part of their livelihood. Sámi handwork features both materials and design inspiration from their native lands. 

Students in this class will explore more complex designs in Sámi-inspired jewelry by making a Sámi-inspired leather bracelet with pewter thread, using traditional Sámi design, and a reindeer-antler button. You will learn several advanced designs and choose one to complete as a bracelet the day of the class. While more sewing is involved in these advanced designs, the construction of the bracelet remains essentially the same as in the introductory class. The pewter thread is nickel free and contains 4% silver. The technique involves very close handwork.
