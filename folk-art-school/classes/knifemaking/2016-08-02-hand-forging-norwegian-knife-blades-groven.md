Learn to forge blades for your own brukskniv (working knife) from start to finish. In this two-day class students will learn the basic forging techniques of how the gas forge, anvil, and hammer work. Students will forge several three-layer Norwegian knife blades while learning how to heat-treat and grind the blade.
