### This class is currently full. However, we often receive cancelations. Please call 563-382-9681 to be placed on a wait list. 

Fill up your carving-tool roll with some self-made carving tools! In this three-day class you will make steel-faced carving gouges and a scorp. “Steel-faced” means the body of the tool will be made of low- or medium-carbon steel and the cutting edge will have high-carbon steel forge-welded to the body. This is the old way of making them! The gouges will be forged into shape from round stock, followed by decorative filing. The scorp will not be filed. All tools will be heat-treated and we will make an edge on them. Then you can go home to make wood chips and K.J. hopes you will make some more gouges for your lonely tool roll!
