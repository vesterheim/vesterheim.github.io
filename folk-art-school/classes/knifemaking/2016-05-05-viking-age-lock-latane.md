This “Norse”-style forerunner of the modern padlock has a “U” shaped hasp held in the body of the lock at one end by a spring or springs. To open the lock, the key is inserted into the body of the lock to compress the springs and release the hasp. Remnants of locks of this type were found in the Mastermyr tool chest in Sweden. Lock construction will be a combination of forging and fabrication (sawing, filing, fitting, and brazing). Decorative details will be strongly  encouraged. Students will have a chance to forge some parts and cut and fit others with mortise and tenon joints, braze parts in the forge, and harden and temper spring steel.
