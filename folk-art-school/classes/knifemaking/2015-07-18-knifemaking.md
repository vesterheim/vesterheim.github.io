In this skilled class, students will make the  “two brothers” knives—two knives with handles made of two different woods with silver inlays. Students will also make leather sheaths, using “pauting” technique, for each knife. 

Håvard Bergland, master Norwegian knifemaker, gives his highest praise for Morten’s knifemaking and teaching abilities!
