Through the expertise of these two highly skilled blacksmiths and knifemakers, learn to forge a blade for your own _brukskniv,_ working knife, and finish it with Norwegian wood handle inlays and leather sheath. In this six-day class, students will spend day one learning basic forging techniques of how the forge, anvil, and hammer work, while forging a set of tongs on a gas forge. Day two and three will be spent forging a three-layer Norwegian knife blade while learning how to heat, treat, and grind the blade. Days four to six will be spent making the handle and sheath. 

Håvard Bergland, master Norwegian knifemaker, gives his highest praise for Morten’s knifemaking and teaching abilities!
