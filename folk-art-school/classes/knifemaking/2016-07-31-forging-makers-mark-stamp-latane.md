Metalworkers and woodworkers wishing to identify their products will have the chance to produce a small maker’s mark in tool steel (for stamping hot iron) or mild steel (for branding wood or making an impression in end grain). Stamps can be initials, a logo, or a combination. You will forge a blank of your chosen material and make tooling to stamp recesses into the end of the blank. The pieces will be annealed and the perimeters will be sawn and filed to produce your designs (in reverse). Tom asks you to submit your designs prior to the class to ensure that ideas are possible to accomplish with tools available and time allotted.
