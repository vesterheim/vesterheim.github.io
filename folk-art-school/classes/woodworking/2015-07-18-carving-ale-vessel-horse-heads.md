Ready to drink beer like the old Norwegians? In this class, we will make an ale bowl using one quarter of a birch log section. We’ll use bandsaws, drills, and hand tools, to shape the bowl and horse head handles. The exterior will be finished with chip carving and the interior prepared to hold your favorite drink.
