Visit Decorah with a partner or friend, to learn about traditional European band loom carving and weaving! These two classes, one in weaving and one in woodcarving, make for a fun weekend together. Weavers will learn how to weave elaborate patterns on a band loom (also called tape loom or rigid heddle), while carvers will learn how to carve a one-piece band loom and shuttle. Band looms were traditionally carved and used as sweetheart gifts, so at the end of the weekend, the loom will be presented to the weaver for Valentine’s Day. This is a class two people can share, at Vesterheim and in future creations together! Find information about the carving class here.

Carvers will learn how to carve a traditional Scandinavian band loom. A flat piece of wood is carved using gouges, chip knives, and hand drills to create a unique and personalized loom and traditional flat shuttle. Samples will be available to follow, but each loom will be an individual creation. Carvers will leave the class with a beautiful, individual band loom and shuttle to present to your partner or friend.
