Learn the history of kubbestol and the steps for making one. You will also learn how to pick the proper tree for the size of the kubbestol you want to make (with a trip to the woods.) We will take you through the process of debarking, shaping, and hollowing a log necessary for the drying process. Then you will be shown how to shape the chair to get it ready for the seat. While we will not use a chain saw in this class, we will suggest methods for accomplishing the shaping and hollowing out of the log. You will leave the class with the knowledge of how to take the log from its natural state to a kubbestol ready for carving or painting.
