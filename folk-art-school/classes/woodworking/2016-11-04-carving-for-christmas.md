Give the most awesome and lasting Christmas gifts possible this year—something you’ve made yourself.  How about giving a handcarved holiday figure, or a sturdy wooden toy for a very young family member or neighbor. Warm to the touch, with a safe finish, wood is a great alternative to plastic. Harley will cover all aspects of figure carving.
