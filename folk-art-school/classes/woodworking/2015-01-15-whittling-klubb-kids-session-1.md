Wanted—Kids (ages 10 and up, adults welcome) who want to unplug their electronic devices for a while and use their nimble finger skills for carving! Create stuff out of wood, while learning the safe and proper use of a carving knife, gouge, and V tools. We’ll also learn how to keep our tools sharp. 

In Session I, we’ll practice with a knife by making a hook out of a Christmas tree and progress to using gouges and v-tools while carving on a small wooden container. In Session II we’ll carve a Dala horse, and in Session III we’ll make a pumpkin and Santa. Take one or all three sessions.
