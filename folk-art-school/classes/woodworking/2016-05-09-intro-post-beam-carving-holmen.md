Learn how to carve a timber for a front porch post, garden trellis, door casing, or door header. You will carve a basic design into one 6 x 6 beam using hand tools. On day one we will focus on design, moving to physical carving on days two and three. We’ll add texture, detail, and refinement as time allows.
