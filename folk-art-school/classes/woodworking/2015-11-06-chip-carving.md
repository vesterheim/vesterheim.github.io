Chip carving is an ancient art, found in many cultures, and Vesterheim has many examples from Norway. In this carving, geometric and stylized floral designs are incised on flat surfaces. Boards are usually held on the knee so the work is portable—no big bench required. Keeping knives sharp is the greatest challenge in woodcarving, but for this craft, sharpening the two knives used is easy. The goal of this beginner class will be learning technique. We will carve on practice boards and, if time allows, we’ll make simple ornaments.
