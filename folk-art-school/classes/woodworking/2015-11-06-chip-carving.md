Chip carving is an ancient art, found in many cultures, and Vesterheim has many examples from Norway. In this carving, geometric and stylized floral designs are incised on flat surfaces. The woodenware is usually held on the knee so the work is portable—no big bench required. 

In this class you will learn proper chip carving techniques, as well as knife sharpening, pattern application, finishing, and more. You will have your choice of two patterns to carve, one will be easier to carve and more more challenging. You will learn how to remove all of the chips in each pattern so you can complete your carving after class if needed. 

All knives, tools, and supplies are provided for your use! Marty uses a camera, projector, and screen in class so everyone can easily see the individual cuts and techniques taught. 

No experience is needed and all are welcome. Young people are encouraged to come and learn to carve on EZboard because it is softer than basswood yet holds detail well and carves beautifully.
