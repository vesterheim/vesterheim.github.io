Spoons are what might be called a “gateway drug” to green woodworking. Once hooked, there’s no telling where in carving they may lead you. Scandinavian culture is rich with spoons—from the simple to the sublime. You will begin with a basic project to build knife skills, then progress to carving a spoon or two. The days will be interspersed with hands-on demonstrations, such as sharpening and painting, plus short topic talks on spoon design, wood choice, and finishes. Fred will also arrange a tour of Vesterheim’s amazing wooden spoon collection.
