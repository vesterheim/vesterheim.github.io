Dragon heads sculpted in wood and dragon-style carving have long been a fixture in Nordic wood carving. Over time, sculpted dragon heads show up in expected and unexpected places. Dragon heads rode the prow of Viking ships and adorned the roofs of stave churches. Furniture in Norway during different periods sported dragon heads as did carved ale bowls. The focus of this class will be dragon heads in the round, in a manageable size for a classroom project. Larger dragon heads for a roof line will be discussed. Phil will have examples of dragon heads to look at, as well as books and photos for inspiration. Basswood will be available in various dimensions.
