_Kolrosing_ is an easily mastered form of incised line carving. It’s easy to learn the basics in one day and then it is up to you to practice on your own! _Kolrosing_ was used to decorate everyday utensils, such as spoons and bowls. It is simple and requires only one knife, some finely ground coffee to darken the carving, and a finishing oil or varnish.
