Enjoy a piece of Norwegian-American history in your own home by building your own three-legged chair. We’ll learn about different joinery methods and techniques used in traditional chair making and how to use a variety of woodworking tools, both hand and power. We’ll use an historical three-legged chair from Vesterheim’s collection as our inspiration. This is a perfect opportunity to jump in and begin learning woodworking, or advance skills you already have.
