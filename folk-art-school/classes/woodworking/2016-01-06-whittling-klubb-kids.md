This is the second year of Vesterheim’s Whittling Klubb for Kids. After learning about knife carving safety and sharpening techniques, new students will practice beginning techniques by carving a Minnesota loon, and if time permits, a fjord horse. More experienced students will choose their next project. Sign up for any class option, or all three! You will be grouped by experience and Rebecca will rotate among you for individual help.
