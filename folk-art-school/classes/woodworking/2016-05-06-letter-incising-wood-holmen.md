Learn to carve letters, numbers, and small insignia to mark your work.  We’ll cover how to transfer designs to wood and incise letters and numbers. These skills can be utilized for projects as prominent as road signs and as discreet as a small smiling face that only the most observant passerby will notice. There will be a number of tools available for you to try, including a variety of chisels and v-gouges, but much can be accomplished with a simple carving knife. This type of carving is a great skill for anyone who works in wood. Feel free to bring a small project you have in mind, or simply practice before you dig into a big project.
