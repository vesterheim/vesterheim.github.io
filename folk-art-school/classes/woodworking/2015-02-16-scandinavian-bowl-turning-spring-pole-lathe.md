Turned wooden bowls are an excellent example of functional Norwegian folk art. These common ceremonial drinking vessels are used both for serving on special occasions and in the brewing process. Many were brought to America by immigrants because they were portable and were a “little piece of the old country.” Most old bowls were turned on reciprocating motion spring pole lathes. In this class, students will begin by splitting a fresh, green birch log. Using axes, hand-forged hook tools, knives, and a foot-powered spring pole lathe, each student will create a turned ale bowl to take home and use. Design, layout, axe work, proper cutting techniques, finishing, and tool sharpening will be covered. During the class there will also be lively discussions on the design, function, and culture surrounding these objects, as well as the history of woodturning.
