  teaser: Learn to tell a story in wood! World-renowned carving instructor Harley Refsal will teach you the Scandinavian flat plane figure carving style.

Learn to tell a story in wood! Figure carving in Scandinavia stretches back throughout history, when people sat around warm fires in winter, sharing their imaginations with stories and carving. In the Scandinavian flat-plane style, figures are carved in large, flat planes, created primarily using a simple carving knife. Beginning with tool sharpening, Harley will provide hands-on carving experiences, as you complete a figure in step-by-step fashion. Finish the project by painting the figure and applying a final oil finish. Then carve additional pieces, while Harley offers assistance on an individual basis. Sharpening equipment and finishing supplies are also covered.
