Primarily using hand tools, students will construct a straight-sided stave bucket or pail with a cover. The model for the class is an 1846 container (pictured here) from Vesterheim’s collection on view in the Valdres house. The cover is missing, but based on holes in two staves, it once existed and was held in place with a pin, suggesting that it was not designed for liquids.
