The stave container has been used in rural Norway for hundreds of year to hold household items and many kinds of food. It was the tradition to carry porridge in a stave ambar to a mother as her first meal after giving birth. Stave construction is suitable for buckets, barrels, tankards, pails, ambars, and more. Binding staves around the base was the most common technique for making these vessels, which were often decorated with woodburning, rosemaling, or acanthus carving, combining art with function. The bands are pre-soaked in water and then installed as tightly as possible. While drying, the bands shrink, keeping the stave’s nice and tight.

Primarily using hand tools, Owen will help you construct a straight-sided stave bucket or pail with a cover. The model for the class is an 1846 container from Vesterheim’s collection on view in the museum's Valdres House. You'll have a blast creating your own beautiful, wooden stave container and making your own piece of history.
