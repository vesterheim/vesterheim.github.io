Double-handled ale bowls (ø​lk​jenge) were carved primarily with horse or dragon heads as handles. In this class, we will focus on a lesser-known form of ale bowl from the Sogn region of Norway. A bowl from the Vesterheim collection (pictured) will be our model. Using hand tools, we will shape the bowl inside and out, and carve the serpent-shaped handles. Students will be able to paint and finish their completed ale bowls with a food-safe finish.
