Hans will present you with complex projects and advanced elements of design. He also will cover design and carving techniques. This is a good class for those interested in larger-scale acanthus projects. Enhance your acanthus carving to its best with painting tips from Hans. Bring a practice board (previously carved and sealed) to practice on.
