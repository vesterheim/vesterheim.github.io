Learn to carve elegant, ornate leaf designs in wood. Acanthus carving, a baroque style of relief carving, dates back many centuries and is used to add beauty to both structural and decorative woodwork. In this class we will learn the basic techniques of working with wood grain, the elements of design, and the use and care of wood carving tools.
