Not a craftsman? You don’t have to be. Try your hand at _kolrosing_ “coal-rose-ing,” a fine-line decoration consisting of one cut with the tip of a sharp tool, rubbed with ground bark, then oiled to enhance the design. Kolrosing, a very old and simple Scandinavian decorative craft, has its roots in the Viking times. In class you’ll learn incised designs, such as simple borders; celtic motifs; geometric lines of the Sámi; and flower, leaf and vine forms like those in rosemaling. Kolrosing was often used on utilitarian objects, like spoons, cups, bowls, and boxes. On day one, we’ll start with the basics of knife control and kolrosing in straight lines. On day two we’ll continue with knife control and kolrosing in curves and on rounded surfaces while learning techniques of shading to give your design depth.
