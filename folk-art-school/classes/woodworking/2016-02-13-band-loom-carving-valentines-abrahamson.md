_Visit Decorah with a partner or friend for a fun weekend, each learning a different folk art. The weaver of the couple will take a class in how to weave elaborate patterns on a band loom (also called tape loom or rigid heddle), while the carver will take a class in how to carve a one-piece band loom and shuttle. Band looms were traditionally carved as sweetheart gifts, so at the end of the weekend, the loom can be presented to the weaver for Valentine’s Day. You can share this experience at Vesterheim and in future creations together! See the fiber arts section for info about the weaving class [here](/folk-art-school/classes/fiber-arts/2016-02-13-bandweaving-valentines-delarm/)._

Carvers will learn how to carve a traditional Scandinavian band loom. A flat piece of wood is carved using gouges, chip knives, and hand drills to create a unique and personalized loom and traditional flat shuttle. Samples will be available to follow, but each loom will be an individual creation. Carvers will leave the class with a beautiful, individual band loom and shuttle to present to your partner or friend.
