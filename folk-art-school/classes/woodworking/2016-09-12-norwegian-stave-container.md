For over two millennia people have used stave containers to hold household items and many kinds of food and liquids. The ambar, a vertical sided stave container with three legs, is known from Anglo-Saxon times and they were popular in Norway throughout the medieval period, especially for porridge, stew, and butter. The Scandinavian immigrants brought the ambar to America, where it was a common porridge container in the nineteenth century. These vessels are bound with wood banding and are often decorated with wood burning, rosemaling, or acanthus carving, combining art with function. Primarily using hand tools, Owen will help you construct a straight-sided ambar. The model for the class is an 1827 ambar from Vesterheim’s collection. You’ll have a blast creating your own beautiful, wooden ambar stave container and making your own piece of history.
