Attention acrylic painters of all levels—this rosemaling class is for you! The Valdres style of rosemaling originated in the Valdres valley and is known for its strong but simple floral motif. The Valdres flowers consist of  tulips, roses, and mums and are often painted in clusters, gathered in urns, or hung on ropes or as a garland. They are the most realistic of all rosemaling flowers. In Lois’s class students will create a Valdres design using flowers, scrolls, and abundant line work. This is a great way to learn all about rosemaling in acrylic paint.
