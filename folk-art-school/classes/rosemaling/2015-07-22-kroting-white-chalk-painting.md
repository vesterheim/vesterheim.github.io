This course includes a slideshow of various patterns from the West Coast of Norway with an emphasis on the tradition of _kroting,_ the context _krote_ was used in, the visual language, and the different pattern assemblages found in the ancient krote borders. Johild will demonstrate the various techniques krote borders have been made in. In the second part of the course, you will have the opportunity to make your own _krote._ You can choose to copy old patterns, or design your own.
