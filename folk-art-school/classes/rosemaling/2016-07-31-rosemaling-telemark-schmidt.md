This class will be geared more for intermediate painters and beyond. It will be taught in a retro manner, which means you will be doing more individual pieces instead of a project. Please don’t let that thought scare you. Nancy encourages you to bring some painted panels to practice on and your own pieces of wood, preferably larger, like a 16-inch plate or a trunk. She will go through the components that constitute the Telemark style of painting. You get a much better understanding of Telemark if you have to think about it rather than copy a design. Nancy will help you develop your own design and will have samples available to look at. She will also go through some backgrounding techniques and lettering. Our goal is a better understanding of the Telemark style! The class will be taught in oils, acrylic painters are welcome.
