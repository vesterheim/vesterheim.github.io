Have you admired rosemaling, but were intimidated to join a class? Well, fear not—this class starts at the very beginning. We want to encourage students who have never painted, so the class provides two enrollment options, either four days (April 28-May 1) or three days (April 29-May 1). Students who start on April 28 (this class) will start at the very beginning. We will cover brush selection and care, making a palette, wood preparation, and, of course, brush stroke work. Candace will work individually with each student. This day will be very important for the new painter. 

On the following three days, students from the first day will continue and students who already have some experience will join in. **You must sign up for _Beginning Rosemaling with Acrylic Paints_ [here.](/folk-art-school/classes/rosemaling/2016-04-29-rosemaling-beginning-larson/)**

Topics covered during these days include how to use the liner brush for flowing lines, painting scrolls, and S-strokes; how to use JoSonja painting mediums; and how to paint with acrylics in an oil class. We’ll look at a rosemaling color wheel and learn how to mix paint. There will be opportunities for practice on paper, but we will graduate to wood so you can experience the joy of rosemaling in acrylics on wood. Our rosemaling style study will begin with small wood projects in three styles—Hallingdal on an ornament, Os on a sandwich board, and Rogaland on a small beaded scoop plate.
