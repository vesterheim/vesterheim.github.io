### This class is currently full. However, we often receive cancelations. Please call 563-382-9681 to be placed on a wait list. 

As we study the rosemaling of the old masters, we see a meshing of stylistic elements that will often indicate the areas that have influenced their painting. We might see scrolls that indicate inspiration from the Telemark painters, colors and patterns showing an observance of the Hallingdal artists, or colors indicative of Western Norway’s painting. This is the hallmark of the old, traditional rosemaling—including elements and characteristics of the painting the artists observed around them, or as they traveled to other areas, interpreted in their own individual style. In this class, we will study the relationship between two rosemaling styles—Gudbrandsdal and Telemark. As we paint several small projects together, we will learn the technique, palette, and characteristics for each, while increasing our understanding of their individual design elements. We will also study the similarities between the two. Andrea will teach the design characteristics that are inherent to rosemaling and that form the foundations for both styles. There will also be much discussion on what it means to paint in our own individual styles and with our own voice, just as the old masters did! How do we take the traditional elements and make them our own? We will paint several smaller pieces showing the unique qualities of each style and the relationship between them. (Images shown here are not the class project, but are examples of each style in Andrea’s interpretation.)
