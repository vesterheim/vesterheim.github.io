The Os style of rosemaling uses bright, happy-looking colors and originated in the Hordaland area of Western Norway. This class will concentrate on the history and characteristics of Os—color, flowers, and scrolls, lettering, background techniques, and more. Students can paint an arched door cabinet that is 17 x 22 x 7 inches. The design will be similar to the one pictured, but not exactly the same. Some designs will be available, or Nancy will guide you in creating your own. She will encourage you to try your hand at designing.
