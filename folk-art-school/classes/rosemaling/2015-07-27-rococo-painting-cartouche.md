Inspired by a sled at the Trøndelag Sverresborg Folkemuseum during Vesterheim’s folk art tour to Norway in 2014, Pam has created a flowing rococo design with gold leaf cartouche. Painters of all styles will be comfortable with this design since there are elements of Telemark, Hallingdal, and Gudbrandsdal in the original sled. Pam will also explore how rococo influenced the early rosemalers. Gold leaf will be taught.

Most classes at Vesterheim focus on one rosemaling style at a time, rather than the broader scope of an art style and period. This time, we are focusing on how rosemaling in Norway, in all its variations, fits into general art history and the developments of decorative arts. Once you have studied rococo, you will begin to see it everywhere and in all of the styles of the old rosemaling, painted by masters whose names many of us recognize and painted by lesser known rosemalers. Rococo is one of the easiest to design and adapt. 

Pam says, "The project for this class is based on a magnificent sled in the Trøndelag Sverresborg Folkemuseum, so unless you have pictures of the old items or have been to this museum, you might not have seen it. I have designed a unique adaptation of the sled specifically for this class using Mike Lusk’s 12-inch square box, so there is plenty of room for the beautiful scrolls. I then added extra richness by using gold leaf for the cartouche. Because the lid removes completely, it will be easy to paint for all skill levels. With four sides, you have several options to make the box your own—use my smaller designs, try your own adaptations, or simply leave the sides unpainted except for the corners. Norwegians were master metal smiths as well, so I designed some wonderful faux strap hinges and corners for the box to mimic some of the gorgeous metalwork I saw on Vesterheim’s 2014 tour to Norway. (Did you know that even in the past, rosemaling masters sometimes painted fake hinges and locks on their trunks? Vesterheim has some examples.)""
