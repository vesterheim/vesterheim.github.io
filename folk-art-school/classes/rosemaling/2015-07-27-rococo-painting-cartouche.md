Inspired by a sled at the Trøndelag Sverresborg Folkemuseum during Vesterheim’s folk art tour to Norway in 2014, Pam has created a flowing rococo design with gold leaf cartouche for a tray. Painters of all styles will be comfortable with this design since there are elements of Telemark, Hallingdal, and Gudbrandsdal in the original sled. Pam will also explore how rococo influenced the early rosemalers. Gold leaf will be taught.
