Come join the fun of learning Swedish painting!  “It is my pleasure to present two projects—_the Swedish Christmas Triptych_ and the _Swedish Coffee Lady_, complete with recipe,” Heidi says. The _Swedish Christmas Triptych_ was inspired by the work of Clement Hakansson,1729-1795, and it is Heidi’s sincere hope that he would approve. The border designs on _Swedish Coffee Lady_ represent Swedish weaving. In class you will have the opportunity to adhere linen onto wood to help achieve a traditional “Swedish look.”
