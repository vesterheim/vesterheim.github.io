The indigenous people of Northern Norway were not bound by geographical borders. They followed the reindeer from the Norwegian Sea in the west to the Archangel region of Northern Russia in the east. As they traveled, they saw the prehistoric petroglyphs on the rocks. It was these images that shaped their folk art. Come and discover the Russian folk art known as Mezen. As you paint, you will hear about the history and symbolism used to create this folk art, which is made up of stylized animals, such as the horse, and other symbols from nature. Most of the painting is done with a liner brush, so you can think of this ​class as an exploration of another culture, while practicing line work that will benefit your rosemaling. The class will be taught in oils, acrylic painters are welcome.questions are encouraged and laughter is a must! The class will be taught in oils, acrylic painters are welcome.
