Johild will teach how to draw a traditional design with a contemporary feel. You’ll learn how to make it suitable for an object’s shape. She will teach how to transfer the design to the object, mix paint, and decorate the item in the traditional Telemark style with an emphasis on the free brushwork that was used in Telemark in the 1700s and 1800s.
