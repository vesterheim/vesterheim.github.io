Live near the Twin Cities, but can’t get to Vesterheim for a weekend class? Vesterheim is coming to you with this Vesterheim and Sons of Norway collaboration class. Learn the basics of rosemaling, including the history, strokes, and simple flower and scroll forms. We’ll work on a 5-6 inch design done in color on backgrounded paper or wood in either Telemark or Hallingdal style.
