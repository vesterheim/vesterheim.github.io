There is no time like the present to begin learning rosemaling! This class is for those who have never picked up a paint brush (or maybe have a very limited amount of experience with a brush.) Nothing will be assumed, as Patti guides you through the maze of materials and rosemaling terms. She’ll cover brush basics, like how to pick out the right one, hold it, and clean it. You will play with paint by mixing traditional rosemaling colors and learning their names. You will learn how to prepare a wooden piece, transfer a design, paint, and finish the piece. This will not be a project class, but through learning some basics, a small piece or two may be finished! You will be introduced to two or three styles of rosemaling as you learn. This may seem like a lot, and it is, but it will be presented in a relaxed and fun atmosphere where questions are encouraged and laughter is a must!
