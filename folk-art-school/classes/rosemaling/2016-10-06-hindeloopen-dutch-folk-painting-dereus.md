Hindeloopen painting is a Dutch folk art from the village of Hindeloopen in the Netherlands. Similar to the Scandinavian and European folk arts, Hindeloopen painting originated around the same time and was a popular way of decorating wood articles in homes. Hindeloopen interiors were mostly tile, but interior trims and built-in wall beds were made of wood and available for decoration. Many stylized flower forms and a simplified version of the acanthus scroll are the distinct characteristics of this painting. Versions of Hindeloopen painting include the porcelain painting affect, shadow painting, and the multicolored. By the end of the class you will have completed a sample of all these versions as an introduction to the basics of this Dutch folk art. The class will be taught in oils, acrylic painters are welcome.
