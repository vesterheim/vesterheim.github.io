Have you admired rosemaling, but were intimidated to join a class? Well, fear not—this class starts at the very beginning. Topics covered include how to use the liner brush for flowing lines, painting scrolls, and S-strokes; how to use JoSonja painting mediums; and how to paint with acrylics in an oil class. We’ll look at a rosemaling color wheel and learn how to mix paint. There will be opportunities for practice on paper, but we will graduate to wood so you can experience the joy of rosemaling in acrylics on wood. Our rosemaling style study will begin with small wood projects in three styles—Hallingdal on an ornament, Os on a sandwich board, and Rogaland on a small beaded scoop plate.

**If you have no rosemaling experience at all, please sign up for [_Beginning Basics in Rosemaling with Acrylic Paints_](/folk-art-school/classes/rosemaling/2016-04-28-rosemaling-beginning-basics-larson/) on April 28 as well. Candace will help you start at the very beginning!**
