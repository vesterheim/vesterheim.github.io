This will be a project painting class. The project will be a small cabinet with a shelf and two pull-out drawers on the inside. The overall dimensions of the piece are 11 inches wide, approximately 15 inches high, and 10 1/2 inches deep. The painting surfaces are the door (9 x 12 inches) and the sides (10 x 13 1/2 inches). Students may paint on practice surfaces or a piece of their choice that would be the appropriate size for the design areas. The item pictured here is the class project.
