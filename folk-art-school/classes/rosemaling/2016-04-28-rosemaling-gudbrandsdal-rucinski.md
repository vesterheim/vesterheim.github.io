You will work on two projects during this four-day class. The first project is inspired by the 1700 Lesja church masterpiece of Jacob Klukstad, the father of Gudbrandsdal rosemaling. The second project will be your choice, using one of the many designs Pam will provide. For a challenge, you can try  adapting one of those designs to suit the woodenware you bring. This class is basic enough for beginner/intermediate rosemalers, but will also offer plenty of challenges for advanced  painters. Oils are preferred. Students using acrylics MUST have mastered basic techniques and know their colors.
