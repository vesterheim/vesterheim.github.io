Johild paints traditional Telemark rosemaling with a contemporary feel. You’ll learn the basics of this style, along with the history of rosemaling. You will learn how to mix paint and how to paint flower and scroll forms, plus different techniques for painting background color. There will be different exercises in painting strokes done on colored paper. When you master the main features of the painting technique, you will work on self-selected items. Johild will have some designs available, but will also encourage and guide you to create your own design.
