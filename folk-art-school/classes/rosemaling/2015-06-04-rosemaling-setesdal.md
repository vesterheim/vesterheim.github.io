Is it time to shake up your rose painting repertoire? Do you want to try something new? Maybe you need several days to work on linework, tear drops, and dots? This course will focus on the painting that was found in the Setesdal area. This style has its roots in Telemark and Vest-Agder and is known for its “fan” type flowers, linework, and teardrops. You will explore pictures of old pieces found in Norway as a guide for understanding Setesdal painting. Patti will emphasize learning technique, while leading you through a specific project. As time allows, you will be encouraged to try simple designing _à la Setesdal!_ Best of all, you’ll have fun with other painters while learning rosemaling!
