Vesterheim is so excited to welcome Turid to the United States once again! Turid studied the Rogaland style, with its elegant flowers, under Norwegian rosemaler Bergljot Lunde, and she will teach this class by sharing traditional patterns that she received from Bergljot. Turid is known for her use of colors in the Telemark style and those colors will shine through this style too. Turid says, “These patterns are not modernized by me in any way, but as I paint, it becomes like handwriting, it is very personal.” The flowers and leaves in the Rogaland style are totally different from those in the Telemark style. Tulips are one of the flowers used a lot, along with beautiful linework and symmetrical decoration. The classes will be taught in oils, but you can paint in acrylic if you wish.
