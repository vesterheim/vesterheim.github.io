Gudbrandsdal rosemaling focuses on the lovely three-dimensional look of the acanthus leaf, with appropriate flowers to add more color. It is usually painted on a dark background. The project for this class will be a Tavern Mirror, or you can choose any other project of your choice, selecting from one of Judy’s patterns.
