Attention acrylic painters of all levels—this rosemaling class is for you! We will explore the Telemark style with a Bible box project. We will work with a transparent style, using a limited palette and either gold paint or gold leaf to further enhance the overall look of the box. This is a great way to learn all about rosemaling in acrylic paint.
