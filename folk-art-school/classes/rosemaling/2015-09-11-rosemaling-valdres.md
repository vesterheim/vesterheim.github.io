For this project class, Sara will present projects of varying difficulty and students may choose according to their preference and ability. The designs will include basic Valdres flowers and leaves and explore some primitive monochromatic scenes. The painting may be done on tagboard or woodenware. Beginner projects will be for simple, inexpensive items. Some larger designs will be presented for intermediate and advanced students.
