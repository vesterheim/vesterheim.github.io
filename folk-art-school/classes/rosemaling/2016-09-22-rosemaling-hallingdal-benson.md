As described in Vesterheim’s _Rosemaling Letter, Volume 46_, Hallingdal is a most comprehensive and varied rosemaling style, with amazing details in each form of scroll and flower. This class will concentrate on traditional Hallingdal designs, flowers, and palette colors. Hallingdal is usually a symmetrical style, using bold flowers, leaves and scrolls. The Hallingdal area in Norway produced many excellent painters and we will study many of their pieces, in the museum’s collections and in books. Designing is an important element in rosemaling. Donna will have some designs available, but will also encourage and guide students to create their own. The class will be taught in oils, but students will be able to use acrylics if they have that experience. The class project is yet to be determined.
