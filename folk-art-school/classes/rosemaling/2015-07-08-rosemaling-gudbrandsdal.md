The elements of the Gudbrandsdal style—the color palette and the historical origins—will all be presented and studied in this class. You will spend time in the museum studying and sketching the carving, which is fundamental to the Gudbrandsdal style. From there you will work in the classroom on the elements to build the design and the techniques inherent in painting it. You will then go in your own unique direction, designing pieces you bring with you and using the designs and patterns prepared as inspiration. This will be a wonderful opportunity to immerse yourself in the richness and drama of this beautiful style of painting.
