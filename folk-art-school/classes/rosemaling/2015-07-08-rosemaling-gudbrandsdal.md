In this class, you will focus on studying the beauty and drama of the Gudbrandsdal style of rosemaling. By making sketches of artifacts in the museum and studying the acanthus carving there, we will work to understand the flow and gradations of light and shadow in this style. Andrea will offer designs for two different patterns, one that is simpler and will help you learn Andrea's painting techniques and interpretation of the style, and one that is more involved. For those who took Andrea's class at Vesterheim in 2014, this class will be a wonderful continuation of study, and for those new to the style and Andrea's teaching, it will be a chance to really focus on the elements of this beautiful style. Time will be spent on studying the history, technique, palette, and culture of the Gudbrandsdal style. The five-day class offers time to really focus on putting your study into practice by painting projects and creating designs!
