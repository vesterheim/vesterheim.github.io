In this class we will expand on the basic elements of rosemaling—linework, scrolls, and flowers. This is an extension of _Rosemaling Bascis for the Very Beginner_ (offered in 2015 and in the fall of 2016). Through guided learning, you will work on three small projects that will build your foundations needed for rosemaling. These small projects will be in different styles, so that you can see different styles of rosemaling. There will be ample amounts of laughter to make this a fun experience. The class will be taught in oils, acrylic painters are welcome. The picture here is an example, not one of the projects.
