The Dala Horse has become the national symbol and best-selling souvenir of Sweden. In this class we will explore its history, from its primitive beginnings to the shiny red-orange horse we know today. We will adorn all sorts of surfaces, from ornaments to coffee servers to carved figures,including Dala horses, roosters, pigs, and “all things Swedish.” There will be no end to “Daling it up!”
