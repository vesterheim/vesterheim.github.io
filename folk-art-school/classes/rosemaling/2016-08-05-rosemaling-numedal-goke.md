Prior to the publication of Nils Ellingsgard and Gry Charlotte Ljøterud Andersen’s book on the rosepainting from Numedal, not much was known about painting from this area. Very recent research from Numedal has found that this style influenced painting found in Telemark, not the other way around! Also, the earliest known woman rosepainter was from Numedal, Kongsbergmålern, who painted in the Kongsberg Church in the 1760s! So what does that have to do with this class? This early painting from the area will inspire us to create something for today. This project class will be a mix of history and painting, with doses of laughter. There will be an emphasis on learning painting skills from Numedal and elsewhere, which you can use as you continue on your painting journey. The class will be taught in oils, acrylic painters are welcome. The example pictured here is not the class project.
