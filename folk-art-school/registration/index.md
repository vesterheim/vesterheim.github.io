Supplies and Class Info
-----------------------
Class instruction is held from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. unless otherwise noted, unless otherwise noted in the class description. Most classes allow for extra work time in the evenings. All Vesterheim classes are limited in size to assure a quality learning experience.

Before each class begins, all students will receive supply lists and handouts from their instructors, a detailed class schedule, and a list of any special equipment needed for the class. The supply list may include a materials fee for specific items required for the class. Vesterheim can provide rosemalers with paints, brush cleaner, and painting medium for a palette fee. These supplies must be ordered in advance. Students might want to bring additional equipment for their own personal needs, such as a swinging arm lamp for extra lighting.

Vesterheim does not allow videotaping during classes, or auditing a class. Vesterheim is not responsible for the security of property belonging to students and instructors. Smoking is not permitted inside any building at Vesterheim Museum. Alcohol is not permitted in classrooms and workshops with exception of some cooking classes. The use of illegal drugs is prohibited.

Deposit, Payment, and Cancelations
----------------------------------
**All classes require a $50 deposit to register.** Full tuition is due 21 days prior to the class starting date. A minimum number of registered students is required for a class to be held.  We must meet our minimum number 21 days before class, or the class will be cancelled.

If Vesterheim cancels a class, a full refund will be made, or students may transfer funds to another class offered the same year. 

**If a student wishes to cancel enrollment, a 21-day notice in writing (e-mail is acceptable) is required for a full refund, less a $25 handling fee. Students withdrawing 20 days or less prior to the start date of a class will receive no refund.**

Age Policy and Youth Discounts
------------------------------
All classes at Vesterheim are open to adults 18 years and older. Vesterheim strongly believes in the importance of keeping our Scandinavian traditions alive by passing them down to our children and nurturing inter-generational learning. Therefore, some courses are open to students under the age of 18, provided they are accompanied by a fully enrolled adult in the same class. Minimum age requirements are determined by the individual instructors and are included in the course descriptions.

Youth tuition will be discounted 25% when youth are accompanied by a fully enrolled adult in the same class. Tuition for Luther students is discounted 25%.

Local Resident Discounts
------------------------
Vesterheim offers a 50% discount for class tuition on a space-available, stand-by basis to any legal year-round resident of Winneshiek County, Iowa. Students will be notified about availability of an opening in the class one week before the starting date of the class. Discounts do not include materials fee. If local area residents want a guaranteed place in a class they must pay regular class tuition. Proof of legal residency (Iowa ID or Iowa driver’s license) is required.

Housing and Food
----------------
Students must make their own housing and dining arrangements.
