Celebrating 50 years of Vesterheim’s Folk Art School!
------------------------------------
Take a class at Vesterheim in 2016! We are celebrating the 50th anniversary of our Folk Art School, which began in 1967 with classes taught by Norwegian painter Sigmund Aarseth. The school grew quickly to offer over 40 classes annually and, during this special year, we are offering over 60! Join in as we pass on this beautiful heritage to future generations.

The Norwegian folk-art tradition reaches back to the days of the Vikings and continues to be vibrant and active today. The class choices at Vesterheim reflect the varied opportunities in Norwegian folk art, including fiber arts, woodworking, rosemaling, food, jewelry, and knifemaking. The Folk Art School also offers occasional instruction in other traditions as a great way to deepen the folk-art experience. 

The joy of creating something by hand is matchless, whether you are a beginner or an experienced artist. At Vesterheim’s Folk Art School, students and instructors create a community of learning by sharing oral tradition and hands-on example. 

The process of making functional and beautiful objects with our hands expands our minds, broadens our outlook, and connects us to one another. We invite everyone to learn new skills, hone old skills, share stories, have fun, and become a part of an exciting community. 

A unique aspect of taking classes at Vesterheim is studying the museum’s collections, which include early folk art from all areas of Norway, representing many varied traditions and modern pieces that have been systematically collected for decades. Classes often arrange for the museum’s curatorial staff to give specialized tours of collections storage. People enrolled in a class are welcome to tour the museum at no cost during the time their class is in session.
