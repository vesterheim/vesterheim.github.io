Experience the joy of making things!
------------------------------------
The joy of creating something by hand is matchless, whether you are a beginner or an experience artist. At Vesterheim’s Folk Art School, students and instructors create a community of learning by sharing through oral tradition and hands-on example.

Vesterheim’s Folk Art School began in 1967 with two classes and quickly grew to offer over 40 classes annually. The Norwegian folk-art tradition reaches back to the days of the Vikings and forward to a vibrant and active present. The class choices at Vesterheim reflect the varied opportunities in Norwegian folk art , including fiber arts, woodworking, rosemaling, food, jewelry, and knifemaking. The Folk Art School also offers occasional instruction in other traditions as a great way to deepen the folk-art experience.

The process of making functional and beautiful objects with our hands expands our minds, broadens our outlook, and connects us to each other. We invite everyone to join in with active hands and curious minds to take classes, learn new skills, hone old skills, share stories, have fun, and become part of an exciting community.

A unique aspect of taking classes at Vesterheim is studying the museum’s collections, which include early folk art from all areas of Norway, representing many and varied traditions, as well as modern pieces that have been systematically collected for decades. Classes often arrange for the museum’s curatorial staff to give specialized tours of collections storage. People enrolled in a class are welcome to tour the museum at no cost during the time their class is in session.
