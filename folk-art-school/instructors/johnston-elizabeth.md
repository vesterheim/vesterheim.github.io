Elizabeth Johnston, Sheltand, United Kingdom, is a Shetland spinner and knitter. She learned much of her craft as a child, observing and receiving lessons from family and friends. She uses these age-old skills, handed down through generations, to turn Shetland fleece into beautiful soft yarns and Fair Isle and lace items for her business, Shetland Handspun. Interest in the long history of Shetland textiles led to research into historic fabrics and the warp-weighted loom. She is author of two chapters in _Shetland Textiles 800 BC to the Present_, edited by S.Laurenson. Elizabeth has demonstrated, lectured, and taught workshops in spinning, lace, and Fair Isle knitting throughout Europe and the United States.
