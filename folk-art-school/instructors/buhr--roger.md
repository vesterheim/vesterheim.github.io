Roger Buhr, Decorah, Iowa, has stitched _hedebos√∏m_ for over 18 years and has taught courses at Vesterheim and the John C. Campbell Folk School in Basstown, North Carolina. When he first saw a piece of _hedebo,_ he was intrigued by the technique used to make this needle lace.   He is a retired Lutheran pastor who served parishes in Iowa and Minnesota. He enjoys gardening, photography, calligraphy, singing and liturgical art.
