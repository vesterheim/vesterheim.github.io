Sallie Haugen DeReus, a third generation Norwegian-American, is a 1974 Vesterheim Gold Medalist who has been painting since the late 1960s. Her early instructors were Sigmund Aarseth, Nils Ellingsgard, and Bergljot Lunde. She partnered for 30 years with Sigmund Aarseth on commissioned interior decoration and helped him teach three classes for Vesterheim in Scandinavian interior design. Her work has been shown in numerous shows over the years including _Norwegian Folk Art: The Migration of a Tradition_, a traveling exhibition curated by Vesterheim. Sallie has taught and judged rosemaling from the East to West Coasts. Years of painting experience gave her the ability to pick up Swedish Dalarna painting along the way. She has a B.S. in Applied Art with an emphasis on Interior Design.
