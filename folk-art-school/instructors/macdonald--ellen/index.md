Ellen Macdonald was a tomboy as a child and usually had a jackknife in her pocket. As an adult, she searched for the perfect outlet for her love of working with wood. When she discovered Wayne Barton and his revival of chip carving, she had arrived. She has been privileged to study with Wayne and has been chip carving actively for the past six years.
