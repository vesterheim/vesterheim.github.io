Heather Torgenrud of Arlee, Montana, has been weaving for over 40 years and enjoys teaching bandweaving classes around the country. She is the author of [*Norwegian Pick-up Bandweaving*](https://store.vesterheim.org/books/folk-art/norwegian-pick-up-bandweaving-by-heather-torgenrud/?utm_source=instructor%20page&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_term=Norwegian%20Pick-up%20Bandweaving&amp;utm_content=Norwegian%20Pick-up%20Bandweaving&amp;utm_campaign=Norwegian%20Pick-up%20Bandweaving) (newly published in 2014) and has written several articles for the magazine _Handwoven_. 

She first dreamed of writing a book when the gift of an inkle loom sparked not only a passion for weaving pick-up bands but a longing to know their history. The dream finally took shape when she and her husband were immersed in studying Norwegian and she discovered some intriguing stories waiting to be told. With the book, she brings together award-winning skills with her easy, readable writing style, to create a well-researched and fascinating look at this historic craft.
