Pam Rucinski has been rosemaling since 1974. She teaches all over the United States, has taught in Japan, and has traveled to Russia for folk art studies. Pam received her Gold Medal in 1995, in part for her Gudbrandsdal painting. She has developed her own subtle variations over the 20+ years she has painted this style, looking to Jacob Klukstad and baroque wood carving for her inspiration. Through the Wisconsin Arts Board, Pam has worked with three apprentices concentrating on the Gudbrandsdal style. Pam has taught at Vesterheim several times.
