Reggie Delarm grew up and still lives in an old family homestead in Connecticut. After attending college for fine arts, she worked as a graphic designer and started a pottery company in 1986. Always interested in history, she also designs period clothing, knits, quilts, spins, and weaves. For the past 15 years she has been weaving on the band loom and has written an instructional book, *Tape Loom Weaving… Simplified*. She teaches weaving and pottery at museums and shows across the country.
