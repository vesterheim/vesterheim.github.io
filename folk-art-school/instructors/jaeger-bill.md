Bill Jaeger is a figure carver in the traditional Swedish-Norwegian style. He earned his Vesterheim Gold Medal in 2009. He has been a carving instructor at the American Swedish Institute in Minneapolis since 2002 and has had the chance to introduce many students to the joys of woodcarving. Billâ€™s theory of teaching is to learn the history, understand the technique, and create a hobby for life.
