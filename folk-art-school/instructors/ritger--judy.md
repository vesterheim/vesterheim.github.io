Judy Ritger is the first artist to be a Vesterheim Gold Medalist in two media—rosemaling and woodworking. Judy learned the art of *kolrosing* in Norway from Ragnvald Frøysadal and has brought that knowledge to the United States. She has taught *kolrosing* classes all over the country and has produced a video called *Reviving a Lost Art—Kolrosing*.
