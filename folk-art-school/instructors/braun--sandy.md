Sandy Braun loves all things Scandinavian! Growing up in a home with a Norwegian grandmother who frequently traveled to her homeland, Sandy was surrounded with the treasures of rosemaling, Hardanger embroidery, knitted sweaters, and traditional foods. Forty years ago she took her first rosemaling class and began a love affair with her paint brushes. At Asapartnerat Banbury Fair, a shop in Bartlett, Illinois, she has taught classes in rosemaling and *Dalmalning*. She is a member of the Society of Decorative Painters, which gave her the Priscilla Hauser Award for Business and Industry in 2003.
