Ellen Macdonald is a graduate of the University of Michigan, who has lived in Decorah for more than 30 years. During her careers in social work and IT support, she dabbled in many kinds of woodcarving. After retiring, she studied chip carving with Wayne Barton, the man responsible for the renaissance of chip carving in the United States and abroad. Ellen carves while sitting at a table in the front of Java Johnâ€™s Coffee House in Decorah on Tuesdays at lunch time. She especially enjoys carving commemorative plates and Christmas ornaments.
