Owen Christianson is a Ph.D research scientist/ engineer specializing in cryogenics, superconductors, and thermal aspects of motors and generators. As a hobby, Owen studies Scandinavian woodworking and he taught a *grindbygningen* (timber frame) class at Vesterheim in 2014. When asked how much wind it would take to blow over his camping *grind*, his reply was, “give me some time and I can figure that out.”
