Owen Christianson is a Ph.D research scientist/engineer specializing in cryogenics, superconductors, and thermal aspects of motors and generators. As a hobby, Owen studies Scandinavian woodworking and he taught a _grindbygningen_ (timber frame) class at Vesterheim in 2014. When asked how much wind it would take to blow over his camping _grind_, his reply was, “give me some time and I can figure that out.”
