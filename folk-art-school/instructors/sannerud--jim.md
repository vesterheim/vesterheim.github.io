Jim Sannerud has over 30 years of experience working with wood. The essence of his art comes from respecting and working with the natural order of wood, the beauty of its movement, and the incredible adaptability of different parts of the tree. Jim enhances these natural elements by leaving the raw imprint of his interaction with the tree, like tool marks and hand carving. Having studied in Sweden and Northern Europe, Jim’s love of the raw folk art of these areas results in work that is vibrant, organic, and just fun. His greatest joy comes from teaching— sharing his “infectious enthusiasm” and empowering others to create.
