She has been a rosemaler since 1977 and has lived in Richfield, Minnesota, for 40 years. Shirley has studied with several master Norwegian teachers both at Vesterheim and in Norway. Evenstad earned her Gold Medal in rosemaling from Vesterheim in 1983. She participated in a painting project at Epcot Center in the Norway Pavilion, Orlando, Florida, in March 1988. Shirley currently teaches rosemaling classes through the community education program in Richfield, paints by commission in her home, and occasionally travels out of state to teach.
