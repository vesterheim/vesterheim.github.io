Fred Livesay is a life-long woodworker, who carved his first spoon at age seven and has never stopped. He has been a wheelwright, carriage builder, museum curator, and carpenter, but now teaches carving. Fred studied in Sweden and England and was only one of two Americans to attend an international gathering of 160 spoon carvers, where he was asked to be a guest instructor in 2013. A founding instructor of North House Folk School, he is frequently found in the classroom. While he makes his living as a carpenter, his passion and joy remains crafting and teaching the traditions and ‘how to’ of hand-made objects.
