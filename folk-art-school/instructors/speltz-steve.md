Steve Speltz is owner and operator of Custom Hardwoods, where he’s been designing and building cabinets and furniture since 1984. His motivation to carve came from a desire to make some of his furniture look better and he’s been carving for more than 25 years. His training includes classes with instructors at Vesterheim and with Philip Odden and Else Bigton, plus “just plain life experiences.” After six years of competing he received a Vesterheim Gold Medal. To date, Steve has roughed out six chairs. Steve says, “Chairs are furniture too, but a chair from a log, wow, what a challenge! I learned to carve a kubbestol through trial and error and hope with this class you can eliminate some of the error and retain all of the trial.”
