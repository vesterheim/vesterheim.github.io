Martha Owen is a resident artist in spinning, knitting, feltmaking, and dyeing at the John C. Campbell Folkschool in Brasstown, North Carolina. Her adventure in spinning began at the school in 1978. Since then her extended family has included sheep (Corriedale, Shetland, Romney) and Angora rabbits (French).  As a banjo player and storyteller, Martha’s interest in sheep and wool, music, and dance has carried her literally and joyfully around the world. She is a member of the Southern Highland Craft Guild and is co-owner of Yarn Circle in Murphy, North Carolina.
