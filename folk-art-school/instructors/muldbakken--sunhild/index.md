Sunhild Muldbakken has studied with many Norwegian and American rosemaling teachers since 1971. She has taught various rosemaling styles for 40 years throughout the United States. She has also judged many rosemaling shows. Since her husband is from Valdres, she has traveled extensively throughout Norway and become acquainted with the rosemaling in Norway. Sunhild enjoys all of the rosemaling styles, but is best known for her Telemark designs and traditional color. She earned her Vesterheim Gold Medal in 1984. Several of her pieces are in Vesterheimâ€™s collections.
