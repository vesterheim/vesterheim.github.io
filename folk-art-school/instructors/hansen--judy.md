Judy Hansen, of Rochester, Minnesota, is keeping tatting alive. She learned to tat in 1998 from her mother, Judith Lind, who demonstrated tatting at Vesterheim for 12 years and continued tatting until she passed away at the age of 101. Judy and her husband Dave have been demonstrating tatting at the Scandinavian Høstfest in Minot, North Dakota, for 25 years. Now that their three sons and daughter-in-laws tatting, too, they are known as the Hansen Tatting Family. Judy has also taught classes in Tucson, Arizona; Rochester, Minnesota; and Telemark, Norway.
