Candace Larson, West Lafayette, Indiana, has been a folk artist for 30 years. She has studied with JoSonja Jansen for 20 years and paints with acrylic paint. She teaches painting classes and states “my students continue to inspire me with their enthusiasm.” Candace was a participant in the 2014 Vesterheim Folk Art Tour to Norway. Currently, she writes an Acrylic Tips column for the _Rosemaling Letter._ She demonstrates and exhibits rosemaling at a local Global Festival. She is a Master Gardener who looks forward to spring, and then to fall so she has more time to paint.
