Darlene Fossum-Martin, of Decorah, Iowa, is a third-generation Norwegian who grew up on a small farm in Spring Grove, Minnesota. She has always had a passion for folk arts and the way her ancestors expressed themselves through their work. She is both a woodworker and Norwegian food specialist.

She loves working with wood in its natural form, is an avid _kolroser_, and has carved with Judy Ritger; Harley Refsal; KÃ¥re Herfindal, Voss, Norway' and Leif Ottar Flaten, Drangeldal, Norway.

She says her cooking style is shaped by the Norwegian cuisine of her ancestors. Although she holds a degree in home economics and education, her strengths in Norwegian cooking come from the women in her family, as well as the years she spent living in Norway. Darlene has taught traditional Scandinavian food classes for adults and children of all ages throughout the Midwest, Colorado, and at the John C. Campbell Folk School in North Carolina.
