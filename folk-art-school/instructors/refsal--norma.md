Norma Refsalâ€™s passion for metalsmithing began when her family lived in Telemark, Norway, in the late 1980s. After gaining experience, she began creating jewelry for the 21st century based on traditional Scandinavian-inspired, or neo-Nordic, designs. She creates jewelry for daily wear out of silver, leather, wood, and enamel, finding the simplicity of the design to be both timeless and elegant.
