Roger Abrahamson is a traditional bowl turner. Using spring pole lathes, hand forged tools, and freshly harvested native woods, he specializes in the creation of Norwegian ale vessels. His fascination for these objects has its roots in his immigrant grandmother’s ale bowl, which is still in the family. Roger has demonstrated his art at Vesterheim’s Nordic Fest, Norsk Høstfest, the Minnesota State Fair, the Smithsonian Institute’s Viking Exhibition, and several other events and historic sites. He has been a turner and demonstrator for 18 years, working almost exclusively with a pole lathe the past 15 years.
