Sue Sutherland studied apparel and textile design manufacturing and learned to make *bunader* from Thorbjorg Ugland and Molle Horn, both from Heimen Husflid in Oslo. For many years she embroidered *bunader* for Oddenâ€™s Norsk Husflid in Wisconsin, until she purchased the *bunad* part of their business in the mid-1990s. Since then she has been making *bunader*, teaching bunad courses, and offering authentic materials and accessories through her store, Bunad Butikken, in Ely, Minnesota.
