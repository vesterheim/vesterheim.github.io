Faith Clover recently retired from the University of Minnesota where she taught art education. She is an active member at the American Swedish Institute and practices many Scandinavian handcrafts, including figure carving, birch bark weaving, and spoon carving. As she learned more about traditional Scandinavian crafts, she became interested in luffarsloÌˆjd, wirework, and has taken classes at Saterglantan, a folk school in Dalarna, Sweden, to learn more.
