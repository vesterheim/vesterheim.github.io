Phyllis Knutson found her passion for weaving in 1992 and hasn’t looked back since. Her award-winning creations using this beautiful, leather-like bark have been displayed and shown at art shows and galleries throughout the Midwest and her work has been featured in Gloria Adrian’s book, _Women Who Work With their Hands_. Phyllis teaches around the country. She is passionate about the art of basket weaving, which she feels gives her a door into the lives of people from many parts of the world. They have become her friends and partners in assuring the ancient art of birch bark basket weaving lives on.
