The Old Ballard Liquor Company located in Seattle, Washington, produces more varieties of aquavit than any other distillery in the United States. After living in Sweden for a time, Lexi developed a great appreciation for this hard-to-find spirit and set about creating a line of regionally distinct aquavits to satisfy the demand left by disappearing imported brands. Providing educational opportunities about aquavit and aquavit culture is the culmination of exhaustive research and hands-on distilling experience, and has quickly established her as the foremost expert in aquavit in the United States.
