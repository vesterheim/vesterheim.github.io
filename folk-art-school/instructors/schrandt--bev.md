Bev Schrandt, Ossian, Iowa, is a self-taught wheat artist who began this folk art in 1976, when her daughter’s second-grade teacher asked parents to share a craft or food for a unit on Norway. Schrandt chose wheat weaving and has demonstrated it to second-graders each year ever since. At Vesterheim she has demonstrated at festivals, and taught folk-art classes and Elderhostels.
In addition, she has shared her craft with 4-H groups, adult education classes, and Sons of Norway camps.
