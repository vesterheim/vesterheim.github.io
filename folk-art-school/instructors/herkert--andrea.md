Andrea Herkert graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in art and art history. She began rosemaling in 2006 and received her Vesterheim Gold Medal in 2013 after receiving ribbons on six pieces, including one Best of Show Award. She has been teaching rosemaling since 2010. Andrea is in her studio full-time where she paints for commission and for local organizations. She teaches many students privately and for seminars throughout the United States. She paints and teaches all of the major rosemaling styles, but feels that her passion lies in the disciplines of Gudbrandsdal and Telemark.
