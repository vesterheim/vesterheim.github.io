Andrea Herkert graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with majors in art and art history. After spending many years doing freelance work and juried art shows exhibiting her work in calligraphy and watercolor illustration, she began rosemaling in 2006. Painting rosemaling fulfilled a life-long dream and after her first class she embraced the art, studying with many master artists from the United States and Norway. She received her Vesterheim Gold Medal in 2013.

She has been teaching rosemaling since 2010 and has received numerous awards for her work. She teaches and paints in many styles but feels that her strengths and passion are with Gudbrandsdal and Telemark, which is the style of her ancestors.

In 2014 Andrea traveled to Norway for the first time on a Vesterheim study tour. This trip completely changed the way she viewed the art of rosemaling and how she approaches it. She gained a greater understanding of the artists and their work by observing firsthand how they brought their own personal style to their art and how they were greatly influenced by the work of other painters who traveled around the country. She now strives to be even more deliberate and true to the heritage and traditions of rosemaling, while confidently painting in her own unique style.
