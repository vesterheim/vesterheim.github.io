Hélène Magnússon is an Icelandic knit designer with a degree in fashion. She believes that the best way to preserve Icelandic traditions is to continue using them, giving them new life. She’s the author of two books—*Icelandic Color Knitting: Using Rose Patterns* and *Icelandic Handknits: 25 Heirloom Projects and Techniques*. She has published patterns in books, magazines, and on her website [icelandicknitter.com](http://icelandicknitter.com). She developed her own range of luxury lace yarns and, on tours she organizes in Iceland, she shares her genuine passion for her country’s rich knitting heritage.
