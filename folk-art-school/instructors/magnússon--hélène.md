Hélène Magnússon is an Icelandic knit designer with a degree in textile and fashion. Her research on Icelandic knitting traditions has earned her the respect of textile historians and museum curators throughout Iceland and around the world. She believes that the best way to preserve Icelandic traditions is to continue using them, giving them new life. She’s the author of two books—*Icelandic Color Knitting: Using Rose Patterns* and *Icelandic Handknits: 25 Heirloom Projects and Techniques*. She has published patterns in books, magazines, and on her website [icelandicknitter.com](http://icelandicknitter.com). Her patterns are inspired by tradition but have a modern twist. She developed her own range of luxury lace yarns and, on tours she organizes in Iceland, she shares her genuine passion for her country’s rich knitting heritage.
