_Syttende Mai_ will be celebrated at Vesterheim this year on Saturday, May 16, 2015.

_Syttende Mai_, May 17, is the day Norway ratified its constitution in 1814 at Eidsvoll. They did not, however, become independent from Sweden until 1905 and until then _Syttende Mai_ celebrations were frowned upon and even forbidden.

Now, Norwegians celebrate their constitution with excited crowds, especially children, marching through the streets waving flags, singing songs, and celebrating their nationâ€™s independence.

_Syttende Mai_ is a great opportunity to celebrate freedom wherever it occurs. Past celebrations have included free admission to the museum all day, a children's parade through Decorah, a Foot-Notes dance, musical performances, gallery talks, and other family activities. Check back for detailed information about this year's event.
