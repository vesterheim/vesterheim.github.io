_Syttende Mai_ is the day Norway ratified its constitution in 1814 at Eidsvoll. They did not, however, become independent from Sweden until 1905 and until then _Syttende Mai_ celebrations were frowned upon and even forbidden.

Now, Norwegians celebrate their constitution with excited crowds, especially children, marching through the streets waving flags, singing songs, and celebrating their nation’s independence. _Syttende Mai_ is a great opportunity to celebrate freedom wherever it occurs. 

Find an album of pictures from the 2015 celebration [here.](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152832768844109.1073741882.18263584108&type=1) Details will be announced later for the 2016 _Syttende Mai_ celebration.

Hear the tale of this voyage around the world in 1913-1914, based on the letters and journals of Gronningsæter's grandmother. The ship, a full rigger captained by Gronningsæter's great-grandfather, sailed to Australia loaded with timber and returned to Norway loaded with wheat. On the way home, in the Atlantic, they found out that WW I had started.
