_Syttende Mai_, May 17, is the day Norway ratified its constitution in 1814 at Eidsvoll. They did not, however, become independent from Sweden until 1905 and until then _Syttende Mai_ celebrations were frowned upon and even forbidden.

Now, Norwegians celebrate their independence with excited crowds especially  children marching through the streets waving flags, singing songs, and celebrating their nationâ€™s independence.

_Syttende Mai_ at Vesterheim is a great opportunity to celebrate freedom wherever it occurs and we observe Norwegian Constitution Day with free admission to the museum all day, a children's parade through Decorah, an evening street dance with the Scandinavian-American band Foot-Notes, and other family activities.
