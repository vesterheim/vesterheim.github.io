This lively day of Scandinavian holiday traditions, crafts, music, movies, and treats is a fun family event that happens on the first Saturday of December each year. Sponsored by Duane and Eileen Bruening.

Children receive free admission!

Some highlights from pervious years include:  

* _Juletrefest,_ when young and old join hands and sing Christmas songs while they circle around the tree and hear about Christmas in Norway. Come early for storytime!

* _Julenisse,_ the Christmas elf, who might bring treats to visitors.

* _Julebukker,_ costumed folk who roam the museum complex scaring away evil spirits. 

* Are you excited about Disney’s film “Frozen”? Search for life-size cutouts of Olaf, Sven, Elsa, Anna, and Kristoff in the museum, try on “Frozen” inspired costumes, and take your picture with your favorite character. Vesterheim will also have a kubbestol, a traditional Norwegian chair, for you to have your picture taken with in front of a Norwegian landscape mural.

* Hands-on ornament making for children, including woven paper heart baskets.

* Enjoy the holiday atmosphere of Vesterheim’s campus with free activities outside the museum. We’ll have pepparkakor cookies and Norwegian chocolate for making Scandinavian-style s’mores to enjoy with hot cider. 

* Demonstrations of folk art.

* Vesterheim’s _Kaffistova_ (coffee shop) will offer an á la carte menu of traditional tastes including _varme pølse,_ pea soup, sweet soup, _lefse_, _rømmegrøt,_ _julekake,_ _pepparkakor,_ rosettes, _krumkake,_ _kringle,_ and _sandbakkels._ Serving 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Vesterheim’s Bethania Church on North Mill St.

* Vesterheim’s “Gingerbread Fair” will be on view during the celebration. Stop by to see creative gingerbread creations by area community members. Gingerbread creations have had a long tradition in Scandinavia and Europe and the tradition continues to the present day. If you’d like to display your gingerbread creation next year, contact the museum.

* Mini-concerts in Vesterheim’s Bethania Church by several Decorah-area musicians and vocal groups, including the Decorah Chorale, the Decorah High School Madrigals, Northern Lights, and Luren Singers. A Touch of Brass will perform in the museum’s Ship Gallery.
