Children receive free admission at Vesterheim’s Norwegian Christmas Celebration on Dec. 5, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

This lively day of Scandinavian holiday traditions, crafts, music, movies, treats, and more is sponsored by Duane and Eileen Bruening.

Here are some of the day's activites:

* Meet Stine Aasland, “Norway’s Waffle Queen” from Telemark, Norway, who will make and sell waffles and sign her new book “We Love Waffles,” which includes 40 expansive recipes. Stine founded Telemarksrøra in 2008, which today is Norway’s largest waffle company. Her goal is to spread Scandinavian waffles all over the United States. 

* The stop-motion-animation classic family film “The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix” will screen along with the short documentary “In the Stream (Bekken)” at 2:30 p.m. in the Bethania Lutheran Church. Released in 1975, “The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix” is a Christmas staple in Norway, where it has sold more than five million tickets and is often broadcast on television around the holidays. Based on characters created by Norwegian author Kjell Aukrust, the film follows inventor Theodore Rimspoke and his friends Lambert (a hedgehog) and Sonny Duckworth (a magpie) as they build (and eventually race) a gigantic car to battle the villain who stole Rimspoke’s original engine design. The film is hosted by Oneota Film Festival and free-will donations will be accepted at the event.

* Are you excited about Disney’s film “Frozen”? Search for life-size cutouts of Olaf, Sven, Elsa, Anna, and Kristoff in the museum, try on “Frozen” inspired costumes, and take your picture with your favorite character. Vesterheim will also have a kubbestol, a traditional Norwegian chair, for you to have your picture taken with in front of a Norwegian landscape mural.

* Enjoy the holiday atmosphere of Vesterheim’s campus with free activities outside the museum. We’ll have pepparkakor cookies and Norwegian chocolate for making Scandinavian-style s’mores to enjoy with hot cider. 

* Vesterheim’s _Kaffistova_ (coffee shop) will offer an á la carte menu of traditional tastes such as _varme pølse,_ soup, lefse, and a variety of desserts, including _rømmegrøt,_ _julekake,_ and _sandbakkels._ Serving 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Vesterheim’s Bethania Church on North Mill St.

* Kathleen Ernst, whose sixth book in the Chloe Ellefson Mystery Series has just been released, will sign books in the Museum Store from 1 - 5 p.m. Her fourth story in the series was set at Vesterheim.

* Vesterheim’s “Gingerbread Fair” will be on view during the celebration. Stop by to see creative gingerbread creations by area community members. Gingerbread creations have had a long tradition in Scandinavia and Europe and the tradition continues to the present day. If you’d like to display your gingerbread creation, contact the museum by December 3.

* _Juletrefest,_ when young and old join hands and sing Christmas songs while they circle around the tree and hear about Christmas in Norway. Come early for storytime!

* _Julenisse,_ the Christmas elf, who might bring treats to visitors.

* _Julebukker,_ costumed folk who roam the museum complex scaring away evil spirits. 

* Mini-concerts in Vesterheim’s Bethania Church by several Decorah-area musicians and vocal groups, including the Decorah Chorale, the Decorah High School Madrigals, Northern Lights, and Luren Singers. A Touch of Brass will perform in the museum’s Ship Gallery.

* Hands-on ornament making for children includes woven paper heart baskets, design your own sweater or mitten, and a great new make your own nisse activity.

* Demonstrations of figure carving and other forms of woodworking, rosemaling, straw-ornament making, spinning, and weaving. 

* Special exhibitions—_Woodcarved Figures, Nordic Roots,_ _From Underwear to Everywhere: Norwegian Sweaters,_ and _From Tradition to Protest: Lila Nelson’s Weaving Life._ 

* Artwork for sale by demonstrating artists and gifts for sale at Vesterheim’s Museum Store.
