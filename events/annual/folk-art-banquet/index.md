Everyone is invited to Vesterheim’s Folk-Art Banquet in Luther College’s Peace Dining Room. During the banquet, we honor the new Ribbon Winners in the [_The National Exhibition of Folk Art in the Norwegian Tradition_](/exhibitions/special/national-exhibition-of-folk-art-in-the-norwegian-tradition/) and the new Gold Medalists will receive their pins.

This event is held the Friday of Decorah's Nordic Fest celebration, which is the last full weekend in July.

Whether you are an artist, art enthusiast, or interested in learning more about Norwegian folk art, please feel welcome to attend! There will be a social hour with a cash bar, followed by a buffet dinner.
