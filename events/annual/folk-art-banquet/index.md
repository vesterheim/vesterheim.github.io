Everyone is invited to Vesterheim’s Folk-Art Banquet in Luther College’s Peace Dining Room! During the banquet, we honor the new Ribbon Winners in the [_The National Exhibition of Folk Art in the Norwegian Tradition_](/exhibitions/special/national-exhibition-of-folk-art-in-the-norwegian-tradition/) and the new Gold Medalists will receive their pins. This year Norwegian instructors—knifemaker Morten Håkonsen, woodworker Torgeir Lirhus, and rosemaler Johild Mæland—will share their experiences as folk-artists in Norway.

This event is held July 24, 2015, the Friday of Decorah's Nordic Fest celebration. There will be a social hour with a cash bar at 6:00 p.m., followed by a buffet dinner at 6:45 p.m. The cost is $25 per person. Reservations for the banquet are due Friday, July 17. No tickets will be sent. Your name will be on a list at the door, and check-in begins at 6:00 p.m.
