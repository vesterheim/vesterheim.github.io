Everyone is invited to Vesterheim’s Folk-Art Banquet in Luther College’s Peace Dining Room! During the banquet, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of Vesterheim's Folk Art School! We will also honor the new Ribbon Winners in the [_The National Exhibition of Folk Art in the Norwegian Tradition_](/exhibitions/special/national-exhibition-of-folk-art-in-the-norwegian-tradition/) and the new Gold Medalists will receive their pins. Norwegian instructors Britt Solheim and Turid Helle Fatland will speak during the program. Britt will present _Skinnfellen—Traditional Handwork with a New Life in the Modern Home_ and Turid will talk about rosemaling, past to present. _Reflections of the Past_ will be presented by special guests. 

This event is held July 29, 2016, the Friday of Decorah's Nordic Fest celebration. There will be a social hour with a cash bar at 6:00 p.m., followed by a buffet dinner at 6:45 p.m. The cost is $25 per person. Reservations for the banquet are due Friday, July 22.
