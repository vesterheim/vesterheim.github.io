Vesterheim offers free admission to the museum the first Thursday of every month. Free First Thursday is always a great time to see what's new at Vesterheim!

Also, we offer an occasional Free First Thursday event, like scholarly presentations, gallery talks, music events, crafts, films, and poetry readings. Check the calendar for future programs.
