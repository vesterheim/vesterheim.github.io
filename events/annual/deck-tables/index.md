Held in November each year, this fabulous community event at the Hotel Winneshiek in beautiful downtown Decorah showcases the talents of area residents and retailers who create beautiful table settings to spark holiday decorating ideas.

Fantastic "Dinner Tables" spark your holiday decorating ideas and the Home, Garden, and Personal Décor Showcase features "Exhibitor Tables" with goods and services to help make your holiday celebrations festive and joyful. There are fabulous door prizes, free carriage rides (Sat. only), games, raffles, auction packages, plus live music and complimentary treats during the Open Houses.

Deck the Tables also includes special dining opportunities—a luncheon and a gala dinner.

Vesterheim thanks everyone for another incredible Deck the Tables event held November 20-21, 2015, at the Hotel Winneshiek. It was an AMAZING weekend! We would also like to extend a special thanks to the volunteer organizers of the event: Melanie Anundsen, Karla Erdman, Llew Jenkins, Ruth Lynch, and Syd Stephenson. They worked incredibly hard to put on a wonderful event that could be enjoyed by all. 

Proceeds from Deck the Tables 2015 will be used to support the 4th Grade Pioneer Immersion Program in 2016, providing an invaluable educational partnership between Vesterheim and area schools!
