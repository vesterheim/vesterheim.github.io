Vesterheim invites all pre-school-aged children and their parents or caregivers to explore art and culture with museum tours, hands-on art projects, and snacks during _Barnetimen_ (Children's Hour). The program is led by ArtHaus directors Jenni and Eric Petersen-Brant and is held from 10:00-11:00 a.m. the third Tuesday of each month from September through April. 

2016-2017 dates and themes are—

* September 20, 2016 - Boats. Visit the _TradeWind_ in the Ship Gallery, then make and sail your own boat.

* January 17, 2017 - Northern Lights. Learn about the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights and paint our own version with special frozen paint. 
* February 21, 2017 - Hearts. Look for hearts around the museum and use them for inspiration to make something special for your sweetheart. 
* March 21, 2017 - Travel. Make some cool binoculars and take them on a trip around the world through art.  
* April 18, 2017 - Houses. What makes a house a home? Visit houses from long ago and decorate your own tiny house.

_Barnetimen_ is free of charge and no previous sign-up is necessary—come to one session or all of them. The program is geared toward 3-5 year olds, but all ages are welcome. Meet first at ArtHaus Studio at 516 W. Water St., visit the museum, and then head back to ArtHaus for an art project. 

_Barnetimen_ is sponsored this year by Brenda and David Carlson, Keith and Amy Bruening, and Norwegian Mutual Insurance Association.

Both are practicing studio artists with extensive experience in arts administration and arts education. Jenni holds an MFA from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a BFA from the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater and has worked as the Executive Director of the Kimmel Harding Nelson Center for the Arts, and Education Director for LUX Center for the Arts. Largely a self-taught artist, Eric holds a BS from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and extensive post-graduate education in the arts. He has taught with LUX Center for the Arts, Doane College, and independently, while also being studio assistant to artist Eddie Dominguez.
