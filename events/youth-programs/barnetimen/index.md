Vesterheim invites all pre-school-aged children and their parents or caregivers to to see like an artist, think like an artist, and create like an artist during _Barnetimen_ (Children’s Hour) this school year. Join Lea Lovelace from ArtHaus at 10:00 a.m. the second Wednesday of each month to explore the lives of immigrants revealed through artwork in the museum’s collections.

_Barnetimen_ is free of charge and no previous sign-up is necessary—come to one session or all of them.

Each month we’ll learn about our ancestor’s daily lives as we investigate colors, shapes, patterns, and stories in all types of artwork. The museum’s collections include everything— paintings, sculptures, carvings, and weavings. 

A Decorah native and a Luther College graduate, Lovelace has worked in the field of Art Education for over a decade and has her Master of Arts Degree in Art Education from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She has taught art with diverse populations of varied ages, directed programs for a not-for-profit community art school, and managed teacher programs at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. She co-founded [ArtHaus](http://www.arthausdecorah.org) in Decorah in 2008 with theater professional Kristen Underwood and teaches art classes there each year.

For information about _Barnetimen_, please contact Jennifer Kovarik, Vesterheim Youth Educator, at 563-382-9681 or [jkovarik@vesterheim.org](mailto:jkovarik@vesterheim.org). 

Sponsored by Keith and Amy Bruening of Decorah, David and Brenda Carlson of Decorah, and Bank of the West.
