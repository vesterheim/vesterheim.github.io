Celebrate Norwegian heritage and discover more about Norwegian traditions at the Nordic Marketplace and Luncheon on Saturday, April 25, 2015, at the Park Ridge Country Club, Park Ridge, Illinois. Hosted by the Chicago Area Friends of Vesterheim, this annual event is a benefit for Vesterheim.

Tickets are $57.50 per person for adults (includes a $20 tax deductible donation); and $25 per person for children, ages 6-12 (includes a $10 tax deductible donation).

The marketplace will feature folk-art demonstrators and Scandinavian vendors with wonderful Scandinavian items for sale. The program includes a special presentation, silent auction, raffle drawing, and update from Vesterheim. A delectable luncheon is served with a special menu for school-age children, 12 and under. See the specifics below.

Bring the entire family. There will be photo ops with _Frozen_ costumes and life-sized cutouts of Frozen characters, plus _Frozen_ items for sale in the Museum Store. A special menu for children will be available and the presentation is interesting for young people, too.
