Celebrate Norwegian heritage and discover more about Norwegian traditions at the Nordic Marketplace and Luncheon on Saturday, April 25, 2015, at the Park Ridge Country Club, Park Ridge, Illinois. Hosted by the Chicago Area Friends of Vesterheim, this annual event is a benefit for Vesterheim.

Tickets are $57.50 per person for adults(includes a $20 tax deductible donation); and $25 per person for children, ages 6-12 (includes a $10 tax deductible donation).

The marketplace will feature folk-art demonstrators and Nordic vendors with wonderful Scandinavian items for sale.
