Celebrate Norwegian heritage at the annual Nordic Celebration and Marketplace, held each spring in Minneapolis, Minnesota, as a benefit for Vesterheim. 

The marketplace features Nordic vendors with wonderful Scandinavian items for sale, demonstrations from skilled folk artists, scholarly chats, delicious treats, and more. The marketplace concludes with a delectable meal and a program, including a special presentation, a live auction, raffle drawing, and an update from Vesterheim.

Everyone is welcome to this great event! Check back for detailed information next spring. Contact Vesterheim at [info@vesterheim.org](mailto:info@vesterheim.org), or 563-382-9681 for more information.
