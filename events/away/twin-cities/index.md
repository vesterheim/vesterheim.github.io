Celebrate Norwegian heritage at the annual Nordic Celebration and Marketplace, held each spring in Minneapolis, Minnesota as a benefit for Vesterheim. 

The marketplace features Nordic vendors with wonderful Scandinavian items for sale, demonstrations from skilled folk artists, scholarly chats, delicious treats, and more. The marketplace concludes with a delectable meal and a program, including a special presentation, a live auction, raffle drawing, and an update from Vesterheim.

Everyone is welcome to this great event! Contact Stephanie Johnson at [snjohnson@vesterheim.org](mailto:snjohnson@vesterheim.org), or 563-382-9681 for more information, or to request a mailed invitation with a registration form.


### 2015 Thank You!

We would like to offer our most sincere appreciation to all those that supported the 42nd Annual Nordic Celebration and Marketplace, including our guests, the Minneapolis Marriott Southwest, our sponsors and all those listed below who gave so generously to help make this event so successful! Thanks to your kindness, we raised over $18,500, which will be used to bring world-class exhibitions to Vesterheim this year and provide a variety of educational opportunities to adults and youth, including top-quality folk-art classes. Find more information about Vesterheim's special exhibitions [here](http://vesterheim.org/exhibitions/special/) and the Folk Art School [here](http://vesterheim.org/folk-art-school/).
