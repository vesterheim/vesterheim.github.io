Celebrate Norwegian heritage at the annual Nordic Celebration and Marketplace on Saturday, April 18, 2015, at the Minneapolis Marriott Southwest in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Hosted by the Twin Cities Area Friends of Vesterheim, this annual event is a benefit for Vesterheim.

The marketplace will feature Nordic vendors with wonderful Scandinavian items for sale, demonstrations from skilled folk artists, scholarly chats, a silent auction, and a _kaffestue_ (coffee lounge) with delicious treats. The marketplace concludes with a delectable meal and a program, including a special presentation, a live auction, raffle drawing, and an update from Vesterheim.

Contact Stephanie Johnson at [snjohnson@vesterheim.org](mailto:snjohnson@vesterheim.org), or 563-382-9681 for more information, or to receive an invitation.
