Everyone is invited to join Vesterheim in La Crosse, Wisconsin, at a luncheon presentation, _Telling Stories . . . With Wood_ by renowned woodcarver Harley Refsal.  

The event will be at Courtyard La Crosse Marriott Hotel, 500 Front Street S, on Sunday, February 28, 2016, from 11:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m. and the cost is $35 per person. Bring your friends!

Figure carving in Scandinavia reaches back throughout history to a time when people sat around warm fires in winter, sharing their imagination with stories and carvings. Millions of people are now rediscovering the beauty of this (almost) lost art, thanks to the dedication and artistic skills of people like Harley Refsal.

Harley Refsal, Vesterheim Gold Medalist, is one of America’s most accomplished Scandinavian-style figure carvers and is guest curator of Vesterheim’s new exhibition, _Woodcarved Figures, Nordic Roots._

Join Harley for a delicious meal while learning more about the distinctive, and often whimsical, figure carving of the Nordic countries and Scandinavian America. 

This event will also include a museum update by Chris Johnson, Vesterheim’s new CEO/President.

Please RSVP by February 19, 2016, by contacting Stephanie Johnson at [snjohnson@vesterheim.org](mailto:snjohnson@vesterheim.org), or 563-382-9681.
