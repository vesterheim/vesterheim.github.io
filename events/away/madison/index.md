Everyone is invited to join Vesterheim in Middleton, Wisconsin, at a luncheon presentation, _Telling Stories . . . With Wood_ by renowned woodcarver Harley Refsal.  

The event will be at The Craftsman Table & Tap, 6712 Frank Lloyd Wright Ave., on Sunday, November 1, from 11:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m. and the cost is $35 per person. Bring your friends!

Figure carving in Scandinavia stretches back throughout history to a time when people sat around warm fires in winter sharing their imagination with stories and carvings. Millions of people are now rediscovering the beauty of this (almost) lost art thanks to the dedication and artistic skills of people like Harley Refsal.

Harley Refsal, Vesterheim Gold Medalist, is one of America’s most accomplished Scandinavian-style figure carvers and is guest curator of Vesterheim’s new exhibition, Woodcarved Figures, Nordic Roots. A retired professor of Scandinavian folk art, he has taught extensively throughout America and Norway, and was honored by H.M. Harald V, King of Norway, with the St. Olav Medal of Honor of his efforts in reinvigorating Scandinavian figure carving both in the Unite States and Norway. Harley was named the 2012 Woodcarver of the Year by Wood Carving Illustrated magazine and is the author of several books.

Join Harley for a delicious meal while learning more about the distinctive, and often whimsical, figure carving of the Nordic countries and Scandinavian America. Harley will share insights about the Vesterheim exhibiton, which features historic works of art alongside contemporary pieces from the collections of Vesterheim and other Scandinavian museums throughout the United States.

This event will also include a museum update by Chris Johnson, Vesterheim’s new CEO/President.

Special thanks to our sponsors Peder & Jeanne Moren, Mike Bovre, and The Craftsman Table & Tap.

Please RSVP by October 23, 2015, by contacting Stephanie Johnson at [snjohnson@vesterheim.org](mailto:snjohnson@vesterheim.org), or 563-382-9681. Seating is limited to 50 people. If the capacity is exceeded, guests will be notified and an encore presentation will be offered at 1:30 p.m.
