Vesterheim welcomes special groups and bus tours!
-------------------------------------------------
We offer guided tours of the museum’s Main Building, the Open Air Division, or both. The standard tour for each lasts approximately 60-75 minutes, or we can create a personalized tour program that fits your schedule. We also can arrange a themed tour around a topic like immigration, woodcarving, rosemaling, textiles, or fine art, or a behind-the-scenes tour of one of our state-of-the-art collection storage facilities. **_Just ask!_**

Vesterheim’s Museum Store is located in the Education Center. If your group would like to visit the store, please let the museum know when you make the reservation for your group visit, so that we can accommodate this into the schedule.

Group Tour Rates
----------------
Adults: $8.00 <br />
Seniors (65+): $7.00 <br />
Children (7-18): $2.00 <br />

These group rates are available for groups of 15 or more. Advanced reservations made less than a week in advance are subject to an additional $1 per person fee.

Special group tours include general admission to the museum for the entire day. The museum’s Main Building has four floors to explore, including three exhibition galleries that change regularly. Vesterheim also has an Open Air Division located behind the museum’s Main Building. This collection of 12 historic buildings is open from May 1 to October 31.

Bus Parking

For your convenience, disembark at the Bruening Visitor Center on the corner of Water and Mechanic Streets. Motorcoach parking is located on Mill Street between Water Street and Heivly Street.
