{: .heading--black--large }

### One Room School House
{: .subtitle }

Ideal for Grades 2 to 5 <br />
1-hour school experience <br />
Cost: $35 per class (does not include museum admission)

Experience education from an earlier time. A schoolmaster will lead students through lessons in the museum’s one-room schoolhouse. Students will use slate boards, with chalk for writing and leather scraps for erasers, and can wear aprons or shirts that are reminiscent of clothing worn by children in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Students will learn more about the history of this one-room schoolhouse, practice counting in Norwegian, sample sorghum sandwiches, and end the session playing recess games (weather permitting). This program is available in fall, spring, and summer only. Please note that the school house is accessible by stairs only and is not climate-controlled.

### Immigrant Trunk
{: .subtitle }

Ideal for Grades 3 to 5  <br />
1-hour presentation <br />
Cost: $25 per class, $2 per student admission

What did immigrants bring with them to America in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries? Why did they bring certain items and leave others behind? Students will visit Vesterheim’s Norwegian House where they will answer these questions through guided exploration of an immigrant’s trunk. Students will touch and examine both real artifacts and authentic reproductions. Additional information about transportation and shipboard life will be shared. At the end of the session students will climb into a recreated ship’s bunk to experience travel and sleeping conditions. 

### Log Homes
{: .subtitle }

Ideal for Grades 3 to 5 <br />
30-minute exercise; 30-minute tour of Open Air Division—optional <br />
Cost: $25 per class for log construction activity, plus $2/student for guided tour (museum admission)

Immigrants and pioneers lived in all types of houses, but many early settlers lived in log homes. Students will build a small home using large, foam logs. They will be provided with a diagram, and will use problem-solving skills in a cooperative learning situation to build the home. Upon request, a discussion and display of tools used in log home construction may be included with this activity (please allow an additional 10 minutes). This activity may be paired with a tour of log homes in the Open Air Division, May to October.
