_USA Today_ named Vesterheim one of “ten great places in the nation to admire American folk art” and it is a “must see” destination for folk artists and folk-art lovers.

Patti Goke is a Gold Medalist rosemaler who comes to Vesterheim to be inspired by the museum’s world-class collection of artwork and the artist community she meets here. She likes to take folk-art classes at Vesterheim and shop in the Museum Store. 

Vesterheim
-----------------
For Patti, choosing favorite artifacts to see in the museum is like picking out a favorite child. However, two pieces that she enjoys seeing and studying often are the big Agder trunk and the trunk painted by Sebjørn Kverndalen. She is always a bit in awe about where inspiration will come from. She can see pieces many times over and yet, when spending time in the presence of the old pieces, there is always something to spark the imagination.

Getting to Vesterheim
--------------------------
Patti travels from Minnesota, south on Highway 52 and, whenever possible, she likes to stop at the antique mall in Harmony, Minnesota, a few miles before she crosses the Iowa border.  The antique mall is on the left hand side of the road when you first come into Harmony. 

Decorah
-------------
Patti is an eagle-holic. She loves watching the Decorah eagles web cam, but seeing them for real is even better! Any time of year, she always drives to the nest just south of Decorah at the Fish Hatchery to see how things are going for two of Decorah’s most well-known denizens. 


She likes to walk along the river on the paved Trout Run Trail. The trail head is on the west end of Main Street, just a few blocks from Vesterheim. It is also a good place to have a picnic. If it is summer, watching the fireflies over the Upper Iowa River or the Decorah Prairie is an absolute must.  

Decorah is known for its quaint small-town main street filled with modern fun shops. Patti usually checks out the sale racks at locally-owned Margaret’s Boutique. She has found unique fashions that she hasn’t seen anywhere else. 

Food
----------
Decorah hosts the fantastic Winneshiek Farmer's Market that’s open in downtown Decorah on Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings from May 1 through October 31. Patti feels lucky when she’s in town during the market and she likes to go there to buy fresh fruits and vegetables, and sometimes lefse. 

Patti starts off her mornings in Decorah with a cup of coffee from the Oneota Community Food Co-op. She says to make sure to get a free stamp card to earn a free cup of coffee. Sometimes she treats herself to a chocolate fudge oatmeal bar. If she doesn’t bring food from home, she likes to buy lunch at the Co-op. Her favorite panini is the Turkey Mango Madness. If you’re staying a few days, get yourself a stamp card for wraps and paninis. Their hummus is great, as well as many of their deli salads. The Co-op is also a good place for a wi-fi connection.

If she is in the mood for pizza, it’s a hard choice between Mabe's and McCaffrey's Dolce Vita. Mabe's is right downtown, and McCaffrey's is just outside of town past Twin Springs and the pretty ride to get there is worth it. 

A new favorite place to eat is the Old Armory BBQ, just across the corner from Vesterheim’s Westby-Torgerson Education Center. Check out their fantastic lunch specials.
