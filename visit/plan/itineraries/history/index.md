Award-winning author and historian Kathleen Ernst visits Vesterheim often, and, in fact, one of her mystery novels is set at the museum. Kathleen writes American Girl mysteries for young readers; a museum mystery series for adults; and American Civil War books for adults and young readers. Reading her work, it is clear that Kathleen loves history and she thinks Vesterheim has a lot to offer.

Kathleen had visited Vesterheim a number of times, but really dived into the collection when she wanted to do research for one of her books. She says, “I thought I’d visit, say thanks, and that would be that. Instead, I’ve gotten more involved. My husband and I have returned to enjoy a variety of special events.”


Vesterheim
-----------------
Kathleen enjoys rosemaling classes, Vesterheim’s annual celebrations, and wandering through the museum’s collections. Kathleen says, “Vesterheim’s collection includes exquisite pieces of different styles, and the museum’s class schedule offers lots of diversity as well.” Readers of Heritage of Darkness, her book set at Vesterheim, will especially enjoy checking out key museum artifacts and galleries from the book. There’s an important trunk in the Norwegian House on the first floor and the Valdres House in the Open Air Division creates the setting for an exciting scene, as well. You’ll have to read the book to find more fun connections.

Kathleen emphasizes that Vesterheim is of interest to everyone, not just those with Scandinavian heritage. Vesterheim’s mission is to “explore the diversity of American immigration through the lens of Norwegian-American experience.” She says, ”I can attest to that. I have no Norwegian heritage, but I find that each visit helps me reflect upon what my own Swiss, Dutch, and Scottish ancestors experienced.”


Decorah
-----------------
After a day of enjoying the museum, a folk art class, or writing, Kathleen loves to take a walk through Decorah’s historic neighborhood on Upper Broadway. She says that the number of historic homes is impressive, but even more so is the diversity of styles of architecture.


Food
-----------------
Kathleen’s favorite local haunt is Java John’s. The staff are friendly and helpful, the coffee is great, and pastries and quiche make a lovely breakfast or lunch. She also appreciates the many electrical outlets and the three-room layout, which provide the right setting for whatever you’re in the mood for. She wrote several portions of Heritage of Darkness in the back room, while enjoying a mocha latte and an herb-cheese scone.

Her next favorite local haunt is the Oneota Community Food Co-op, where she usually goes for lunch. Great food, including a terrific salad bar, is available every day and it’s very convenient to the museum. As a vegetarian, she appreciates knowing that she will always find delicious choices.
