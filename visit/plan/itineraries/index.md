Exploring Vesterheim's Main Building with its four floors of incredible artifacts is a delight. Wandering at your own speed, you can linger for as long as you wish at your favorite pieces. 

These itineraries were arranged in case you wish to narrow your emphasis to a certain theme. Some itineraries focus only on Vesterheim's exhibitions, while others give you ideas for spending time in Decorah and the surrounding area. However you choose to revel in Vesterheim's vast galleries, enjoy!
