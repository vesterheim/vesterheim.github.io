It could easily take a whole day or more to see everything at Vesterheim.

If you can't schedule a full day, here are some highlights that you won't want to miss. You can view these objects within one hour.

First Floor
-----------
- **Norwegian House**
  This house is a model of a rural Norwegian home from the mid-1800s in the Telemark region of Norway.
- **The TradeWind**
  This 25-foot sailboat, the smallest known sailboat to have crossed the Atlantic Ocean without assistance, was sailed by two brothers who left Kristiansand, Norway, on March 26, 1933, and arrived at the World’s Fair in Chicago on April 29, 1933.

Second Floor
------------
- **Refrigerator Door with Rosemaling**
  A door painted by Per Lysne on location in the St. Paul home of Eleanor Ericson in 1939. Lysne was a decorative painter who was originally from the Sognefjord area of Norway.
- **Chip-carved Bowl**
  A bowl turned by Gary Smith. The exquisite chip carving was done by Miles Lund, a Vesterheim Gold Medalist.
- **Dragon-style Carved Drinking Horn**
  A drinking horn carved by Lars Kinsarvik (1846-1925), a major figure in the revival of dragon-style carving, which became popular after the excavations of the Viking burial ships in the late 1800s in Norway.
- **Bridal Crown**
  A silver traditional bridal crown that dates to the 1700s.

Third Floor
-----------
- **The Wise and Foolish Virgins Tapestry**
  A seventeenth-century Norwegian tapestry that depicts the biblical parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins as told in the book of Matthew.

Basement
--------
- **Nisse Statue**
  An impish *nisse*, made of concrete, that was made in 1954 by Halvor Landsverk, a well-known wood carver and sculptor from Whalen, Minnesota.
- **The 99th Infantry Battalion Display**
  This special battalion, which was activated in 1942, consisted  of 100 Norwegian-Americans who were trained to liberate Norway from Nazi control.
- **The Lars Christenson Altar**
  Christenson began carving this altar in 1890. Ten years later, when the altar was completed, the congregation for which he carved it did not accept it. One theory is that it varied too much from the more popular style of the time. Interestingly, the church subsequently burned, but the altar did not, since it continued to be stored at Christenson’s farm.

Open Air Division
-----------------
- **Vesterheim's Open Air Division**
  Even if you are unable to attend the guided tour, it is worth wandering the grounds and reading the placards outside each of the 12 buildings.
