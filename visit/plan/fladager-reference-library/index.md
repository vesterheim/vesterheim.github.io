Vesterheim's reference library includes over 5,000 books for researching topics related to Norwegian and Norwegian-American history and culture, fine art and folk art, and the emigration/immigration story. Many books showing examples of traditional Norwegian rosemaling, woodworking, metalworking, and weaving will be of special interest to the artist and researcher. 

The library is open to general visitors from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 to 4:00 p.m, Monday through Friday. All books must be used on siteâ€”the collection does not circulate. If research assistance is needed, please schedule an appointment with Vesterheim's Archivist, Jennifer Kovarik, at [jkovarik@vesterheim.org](mailto:jkovarik@vesterheim.org), or 563-382-9681, ext. 219.
