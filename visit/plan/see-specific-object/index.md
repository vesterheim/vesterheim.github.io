Is there something you are especially interested in seeing at Vesterheim? With a collection of over 24,000 artifacts, many of Vesterheim's objects are in storage, but we'd like to make sure you have access to your special piece.

* Did your family donate something to the museum? 
* Do you have a favorite artifact you would like to see again? 
* Is there a certain folk-art technique you'd like to study?

If you have a specific viewing request, please contact Vesterheim before you visit to assure access to the collection items you would like to see or study most. Viewing requests can be sent to [info@vesterheim.org](mailtoinfo@vesterheim.org) or 563-382-9681. Two weeks notice is preferred.
