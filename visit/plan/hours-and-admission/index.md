Take your time and tour Vesterheim's Main Building at your own pace. There is a lot to see. If you want to see it all, we'd advise a full day. Don't have that long? Check out What to See in a Limited Time.

Guided tours of the museum’s Open Air Division are included with admission price and scheduled at 1:30 p.m. daily May 1 through Oct. 31. (Tours occasionally take place at different times. Please confirm tour time with a desk attendant upon your arrival, or call ahead.)

**Accessibility:** All areas of the Main Building, Westby-Torgerson Education Center, Amdal-Odland Heritage Center, and the Bethania Lutheran Church are wheelchair accessible, but some of the buildings in the Open Air Division are not. We apologize for any inconvenience. Please let us know if any member of your party requires special accommodation or assistance.

**Photography:** You may take non-flash photos throughout the museum complex for personal, noncommercial use only, and we encourage you to share your favorite shots on Facebook, Flickr, TripAdvisor, Yelp, and other social networking sites. _All flash photography is prohibited and commercial use of images of Vesterheim’s collections or grounds is strictly forbidden without prior written consent._ High-quality images of artifacts are available for a fee. For further information, please contact Alison Dwyer at 563-382-9681, or [adwyer@vesterheim.org](mailto:adwyer@vesterheim.org).
