Decorah is a great place to visit. It’s a perfect getaway that is close by yet seems far from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.

More than just a diversion, the Decorah area, or “Bluff Country,” is nestled in the midst of towering bluffs and beautiful scenery. Winneshiek County and Decorah offer plenty of things to do, see, and experience.

Thriving, quaint shops fill the downtown area, four-star restaurants tempt the palate, cultural and historic venues entertain, and recreational opportunities blanket the entire region. Whatever the season—your stay is sure to be unforgettable!
