Decorah is a great place to visit. It’s a warm and vibrant town that makes a perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.

The Decorah area, or “Bluff Country,” is nestled in the midst of towering bluffs and beautiful scenery, offering plenty of outdoor recreation. 

Some great outdoor attractions include:
* The Trout Run Trail, an 11-mile biking, walking, and running trail that loops the town
* The Upper Iowa River with opportunities for canoeing and inner tubing, or just strolling along
* Numerous scenic parks with streams, springs, and waterfalls; trails for biking, walking, and skiing; and even playground equipment for kids
* The Decorah Community Prairie that includes a butterfly garden, river access, benches, native prairie plantings, and trails for walking, biking, and cross country skiing

Decorah also boasts a thriving, charming downtown full of shops, many restaurants to tempt your palate, cultural and historic venues, and numerous cultural events and festivals. 

Decorah was featured in _Smithsonian Magazine’s_ annual list of the 20 best small towns to visit in America, as well as being named in _Forbes_ ”America’s Prettiest Towns” list. 

Whatever the season—your stay is sure to be unforgettable!
