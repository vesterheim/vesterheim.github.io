In 2000, Vesterheim launched Kroneklubben or “Crown Club” for recognizing our most generous and devoted donors. This special recognition acknowledges accumulated lifetime gifts and is essential for helping us achieve our mission. Membership in Kroneklubben is a high honor starting at $10,000 up to $29,999 for the pewter level, followed by bronze at $30,000-99,999, next is silver with a range from $100,000-499,999, then gold at $500,000-999,000, and ultimately platinum for lifetime gifts of $1,000,000 and more. 

The crown illustrated on the Kronekluben award is a part of the Vesterheim collection. It helps to tell the story of living Norwegian-American heritage that Vesterheim embodies. Bridal crowns were treasures of a Norwegian community, shared by all for marking special occasions. Crowns, like this one from Trondheim, were keepsakes, used to literally and symbolically pass along traditions. Crowns connected generations: as an older woman placed the bridal crown on the head of a young woman, she linked generations, and members of the community, in a celebration of that heritage and tradition.

Vesterheim chose this bridal crown, drawn and interpreted by Norwegian-American artist Elisabeth Maurland, to be a symbol for its Kroneklubben. For us too, the crown represents the ties that bind us as a community, linking us to each other and to those that come before and after us. Your gifts to Vesterheim enable the museum to sustain this mission, to share a cultural legacy, for years to come.  

Just as the bridal crown is passed from one generation to another within a community, your support ensures that Vesterheim keeps its stories alive for tomorrow’s generations. We invite you to consider a gift or pledge to become a part of this prestigious group.
