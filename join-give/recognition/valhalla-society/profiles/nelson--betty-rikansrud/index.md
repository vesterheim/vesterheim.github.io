Betty Rikansrud Nelson felt inspired to get involved with Vesterheim because it was her heritage. Her father-in-law was on the Vesterheim Board, her sister-in-law was an important employee, and her mother took needlework classes. Her true love for Vesterheim began when she started taking weaving classes at the museum.

Betty credits Lila Nelson with being her mentor and teaching her how to be a great weaver. Betty gets the most satisfaction by working with Vesterheim students of all ages and being part of the weaving program. Betty has been a long time helper with the fourth grade Pioneer Immersion Program, where she teaches children basic weaving skills.

Betty was born on February 14, 1935, in Decorah, Iowa. She grew up in Decorah and eventually went on to become a student at Luther College. It was during her time at Luther that she met her future husband, David Torrison Nelson. David had been a long-time resident of Decorah and was teaching at Luther when the couple met. The two were married on April 20, 1957. Betty and David moved to Ames where David got his PhD in physics.

David returned to teach at Luther and Betty stayed home with their four children, Elise, Andrea, Kate and Stephen. She later worked for an accounting firm and also taught at Luther. The family’s history is deeply rooted within Decorah since they spent the majority of their lives here and Vesterheim played a significant role. David served on the museum board for many years and Kate is presently a member of the board.

Betty and David Nelson began a charitable trust through a gift of appreciated stock. The Nelsons hope that their planned gift will help with the growth and continuation of the museum long into the future.  “What people have enjoyed at Vesterheim needs to be available to other generations to enjoy. Vesterheim isn’t just about Norwegian immigration, it is in part the story of all immigrants,” says Betty when asked about why people should make a planned gift. She believes Vesterheim does a wonderful job telling and preserving the story of immigration.
