It was not a special occasion that inspired Dr. Hamlet (Ham) Peterson and his wife, Suzanne, to join Vesterheim’s Valhalla Society. There was no need for a special occasion, because Vesterheim is a very special place for Dr. Peterson, and one that has been a part of his life for many years.

His interest in the museum and its extensive collection began when he was just a small boy. Dr. Peterson was not only fortunate enough to grow up in a household where both parents still spoke Norwegian, but he also had “playhouses” that would have been the envy of any young child. As a matter of fact, he had four, because Dr. Peterson’s father was a professor at Luther College, and at the time Luther owned four of the log buildings that are now a part of Vesterheim’s Open Air Division: the Egge-Koren House, the Rovang Parochial School, the Norsvin Grist Mill, and the Tasa Drying Shed.

After the buildings were moved to Vesterheim in 1976, Dr. Peterson took great pleasure in visiting the museum on school outings. Vesterheim’s collection then, and still today, helped him develop a deeper appreciation of heritage and family. Buildings like the Norsvin Grist Mill remind him of his grandfather’s grist mill. Inside the museum various artifacts bring back memories of family holidays and Nordic staples like lefse and lutefisk.

As his enthusiasm grew, Dr. Peterson’s desire to share his appreciation grew as well. In the early 1990s, Dr. Peterson, a retired orthopedic surgeon from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., helped start the Norwegian-American Orthopedic Society, which meets every other year. He has really enjoyed the opportunity to get to know and network with other doctors who appreciate their Norwegian heritage.

In February 2002, the Petersons joined Vesterheim’s Valhalla Society, which celebrates those who have made a planned gift to the museum. Dr. Peterson hopes that his eagerness to show appreciation for Vesterheim will encourage others to demonstrate their gratitude.

He and Suzanne have also encouraged their family to value their heritage. He noted that “the enthusiasm for all things Norwegian gets watered down” from generation to generation and we need to support organizations, like Vesterheim, that preserve our heritage.
