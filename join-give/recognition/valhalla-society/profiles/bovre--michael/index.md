When we asked Michael Bovre of Madison, Wisconsin, about his experiences with planned giving to Vesterheim, he replied, "It's just so easy." Michael is a long time, devoted friend of the museum and has been a member of Vesterheim's Valhalla Society since its inception more than a decade ago. He wants people to know planned giving is a "very worthwhile venture." 

For many years, Michael has worked to raise awareness about the Norwegian immigrant story as an active member of Vesterheim, as well as President of the Koshkonong Historical Society. He encourages everyone to join the Valhalla Society whether they are a long-time supporter of Vesterheim or just making their first visit to the museum.
