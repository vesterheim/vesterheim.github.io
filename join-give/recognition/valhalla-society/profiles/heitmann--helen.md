Helen M. Heitmann had an educator’s heart. And even though Helen passed away April 7, 2006, her passion continues at Vesterheim through a bequest to the museum. Thanks to her generosity, the Asbjørnsen Gallery in the museum’s Main Building is a wonderful venue for special exhibitions.

Born in Chicago on August 8, 1926, Helen knew from an early age that she wanted to teach. After graduating from Von Steuben High School, she studied history and physical education at the College of Wooster in Ohio. While teaching high school in Skokie, Illinois, Helen earned her M.A. from Northwestern University in 1955 and a Ph.D. in physical education from Springfield College in 1967.

After pioneering individualized curriculum and teaching styles based on fitness levels in Skokie, Helen began teaching at the University of Illinois in Chicago, first as an associate professor, then as a full professor, and later as Head of the Women’s Physical Education Department and the Professional Teacher Education Program. In 1972, the women’s and men’s departments merged and Helen became the head of the unified department, making her one of the first women in the nation to serve in such role.

During this time Helen led the initial drive to convince the Illinois High School Association to allow girls to have the same opportunities in athletics as those afforded boys. Prior to the 1970s, Illinois girls were not allowed to participate in interscholastic sports, but with Helen’s passion for education, strong advocacy skills, and help from women supporters, her dream to improve physical education for all youth eventually came true.

Along with her teaching, Helen was a community leader and a writer. She authored roughly 70 publications in professional and popular journals and co-authored 5 books relating to the teaching of physical education.

Her desire to educate was not limited to youth physical education. Helen also cared deeply about her Norwegian heritage and longed to share it with everyone. She chronicled the works of her grandfather, Norwegian sculptor Sigvald Asbjørnsen, in _From Fjord to Prairie: Norwegian-Americans in the Midwest, 1825 – 1975;_ donated the bronze casting by Asbjørnsen, named “Anitra’s Dance,” to the museum; and bequeathed a gift to Vesterheim for the acquisition, conservation, and display of Asbjørnsen's art.

Helen’s long-time dedication to the museum and her devotion to her grandfather’s legacy were  celebrated in 2011 with the first show in the Asbjørnsen Gallery—an exhibition honoring Asbjørnsen's works, highlighted by a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the gallery by Her Majesty Queen Sonja of Norway.
