Harold Segelstad is a physicist, solar energy expert, and environmental activist. He is also a Norwegian-American who is immensely proud of his Norwegian immigrant ancestors and his Scandinavian heritage. His family taught him the value of embracing change and adventure, while still upholding tradition and cherishing culture. Harold has worked hard to embody these values and hopes to share that legacy through his support of Vesterheim’s planned giving program, the Valhalla Society. 

For Harold, this journey began in the Gudbrandsdalen Valley of Norway in the 1870s with the passing of his great grandmother, Ingeborg. Things had not been going well for the family and Harold’s great grandfather decided to set out for America after the passing of his wife. He had heard that there was land available to those willing to tame the wilderness and so, with his children in tow, he boarded a ship for New York. From there he took the train west to La Crosse, Wisconsin, where he and his sons homesteaded land, farmed it, and, eventually, owned a whole-sale grocery store. 

Born in Ames, Iowa, Harold lived in several different states while growing up and he ultimately settled in California. He has a passion for preservation that extends beyond his deep appreciation for his heritage to a profound love of the land and concern for the environment. In 1970, Harold purchased a 325-acre rundown cattle operation overgrown with brush on the western flank of the Santa Cruz Mountains. He named it “Segelstad’s Sanctuary” and immediately set out to turn it into a forested preserve filled with more than 30,000 redwood and Douglas fir trees. In 1976, he began a career in renewable energy as the Director or Renewable Energy at Pacific Gas & Electric and originated several programs in photovoltaic, solar thermal, and wind energy technology. It was a very different direction from his earlier involvement in nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific test area. Harold served as the Chair of the Renewable Energy Delegation to China in 1984, the Executive Director of ZPG, and as a consultant for solar energy utilization for the Natural Resources Defense Council. 

Now retired, Harold spends his time pursuing his favorite interests—traveling in remote places, the environment, the arts, and his Norwegian heritage. He learned about Vesterheim Museum through his involvement in the Oregon Shakespeare Festival translations of Ibsen and as the San Francisco Honorary Consul General to Norway. Ten years ago he visited for the first time. Harold said he, “was very pleasantly surprised, finding Vesterheim much more substantial” than he had expected. He was impressed with “the variety of exhibits at the museum, the expanse of the outdoor division, and the skilled artisans trained through the folk art program.” 

For the 1994 Winter Olympics in Norway, Harold wore a modern interpretation of a Chieftain’s Coat hand-sewn especially for him by an artist he met through Vesterheim. Later, while in Iceland to watch the launching of a Viking ship setting sail for Greenland and Canada, Harold thought of his ancestors and his trip to Vesterheim. The idea came to him to combine his love of conservation with his love of his culture and support Vesterheim’s efforts to preserve that heritage and share it with future generations. To that end, he joined the Valhalla Society.
