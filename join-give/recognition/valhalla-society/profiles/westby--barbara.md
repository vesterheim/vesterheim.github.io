The late Barbara M. Westby, prominent librarian and educator, made her earliest gift to Vesterheim in 1980. Miss Westby was a member of the Vesterheim Board of Trustees from 1985 to 1997, and active on the Board of Visitors and Founders’ Council until her death in July 2004. In August 2004, her executors announced that Miss Westby’s estate would benefit Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum and Augustana College in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. 

Barbara’s great friend, Ronelle Thompson, director of the Mikkelsen Library at Augustana, wrote, “Barbara was passionate about her Norwegian heritage. She traveled to Norway whenever she could, keeping family ties alive by visiting aunts, uncles, and cousins. Barbara’s belief in the importance of libraries and her enthusiasm for the Norwegian culture were well-known to her friends.” 

Barbara’s was an important career, culminating (from 1970 until her retirement in 1981) in the position of Chief of the Catalog Management Division of The Library of Congress. Earlier she served as field director of The Library of Congress in Oslo. Throughout her life, Barbara’s love of Vesterheim was evident. In her service as trustee, she was generous with her time and support. Barbara frequently gave gift memberships, encouraged donations of important artifacts from her friends, supported the Vesterheim campaigns, donated to the special “salary fund” for staff, and gave to the endowment. Barbara also inspired gifts to Vesterheim from others in her honor. In 2000, Barbara enrolled in the Valhalla Society, Vesterheim’s planned giving group.

Before she was hospitalized for the last time, Barbara told Ronelle Thompson, “I have lived well, but I have been careful. I should be able to leave a goodly amount.” In the months following her death, the impact of her generosity became clear. In 2004, Barbara’s commitment to Vesterheim and her part in the Valhalla Society created a substantial addition to the endowment of more than $500,000. Today, Vesterheim continues to benefit from Barbara Westby’s intelligent philanthropy and her impressive investment in the museum’s mission.
