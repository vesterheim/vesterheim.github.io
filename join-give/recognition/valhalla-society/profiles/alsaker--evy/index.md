Evy Johansen Alsaker was born December 12, 1946, in Fredrikstad, Norway, and immigrated to the U.S. from Norway in 1965. She obtained her degree in banking from the University of Wisconsin- Madison and then settled in the Chicago area, where she began working at the Uptown National Bank of Chicago in 1971. During her time at Uptown, she rose to the position of Senior Vice President and Secretary to the Board of Directors. In 1998, Evy began dating her long-time friend, Robert A. Alsaker, and in 1999 they were wed at Orchestra Hall in Chicago. In December 2004, Evy retired from her position at Uptown.

Since her retirement, Evy has been volunteering nonstop. She has served on numerous boards and committees for various institutions, including, but not limited to, the Norwegian-American Chamber of Commerce, Bethesda Home and Retirement Center, and the Association of Chicago Bank Women. Vesterheim is proud that Evy has served on the museum’s Board of Trustees since 2004. She is also a co-chair for the Chicago Area Friends of Vesterheim. Her work as a board member and co-chair has been invaluable.

Evy’s connection to Vesterheim began in the fall of 1998. She and her husband Rob brought her mother to the museum during a visit to the states. Both Evy and Rob immediately fell in love with all that Vesterheim has to offer. “I got involved because I am interested in the preservation of my Norwegian heritage. Vesterheim is special because it preserves and educates people about Norwegian immigration to the U.S. Being an immigrant myself, I believe the knowledge and impact of Norwegian immigrants is a story that needs to be told and retold and Vesterheim does this so wonderfully,” Evy said, when asked why she was compelled to became a part of Vesterheim’s legacy. She believes that Vesterheim has a lot to offer the community, including a superb fine-art collection and many education programs. She feels Vesterheim has amazing members willing to keep the museum going.

In order to truly understand something, one should get involved. Evy has taken this to heart in all that she has done for Vesterheim. Her time as a trustee has given her a great deal of satisfaction and a whole new understanding of how organizations like Vesterheim work. “For me, as a trustee serving as the treasurer for three years and on the finance committee has been very interesting. The museum’s financial landscape is complex. As any not-for-profit, Vesterheim relies on the generosity of many people to fund its operations.”

Evy and Rob joined the Valhalla Society because they felt that membership and Valhalla go hand in hand. Joining the Valhalla Society is a great way to ensure Vesterheim’s future. Evy hopes that her gift will help Vesterheim to continue as a great ethnic museum for many years to come. She hopes that, by visiting the museum, donors will be encouraged to make their own planned gift.
