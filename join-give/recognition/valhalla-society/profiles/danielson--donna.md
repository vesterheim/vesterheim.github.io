Professor Donna Rae Danielson loved her Norwegian ancestry and that was evident both in the way she lived and in her passing.

Born July 28, 1934, in Nevada, Iowa, Donna was an exemplary educator, creative artist, and devoted daughter. She retired from the Departments of Textiles and Clothing and Arts and Design at Iowa State University in 1991, after 27 years of decorated service. While working, she nurtured her creative side by designing beautiful Christmas cards, many of which are now housed in the ISU Special Collections Department.

During their lifetimes, Donna looked after her parents with love and dedication. As her father, Ray, lost his sight, Donna read to him from books, often about Norwegian pioneers. In 1995, she honored her mother, Vera, by having her name inscribed on the Plaza of Heroines in front of Catt Hall at Iowa State, in Ames, Iowa.

Donna died on Christmas Day, 2006. She extended her warm spirit of giving to Vesterheim by remembering the museum in her will. The modest, kindly educator who inherited the family farm properties left one of the largest bequests ever received by the museum. With this gift Donna will forever be a treasured member of Vesterheim’s Valhalla Society. Her gift is a vital part of maintaining the museum’s quality programs and engaging activities and providing the highest standards of quality and care for its collections.
