_Note - Mar passed away in 2014, after this interview._

St. Paul, Minnesota, residents Marwin and June Wrolstad are enthusiastic Vesterheim supporters who have long been associated with the museum. Not only are they annual contributors who joined Vesterheim’s Valhalla Society by including the museum in their estate plans, they are active museum members who work to share the cultural legacy of Norwegian immigrants to America and inspire people of all backgrounds to celebrate tradition.

Mar and June joined as Vesterheim members in 1975. Over the years they have established a long record of generously providing both financial support and time. Over the years, Mar has worn almost every hat imaginable at Vesterheim. In addition to joining the Board of Directors in 1983, Mar has served on numerous board committees and as Board Chair, hosted several Vesterheim friends events, and acted as Interim Director for the museum in 1997-98.

“We are very fortunate to have Mar and June as supporters of Vesterheim,” said Steve Johnson, Executive Director. “They are constant, long-time, dedicated promoters of the museum and its wonderful programs,” he continued.

Thanks to their generosity, Vesterheim’s Publications Department now enjoys updated equipment and a remodeled office space, named The Wrolstad Publications Center in honor of Merald Wrolstad, Mar’s cousin and Vesterheim’s first Editor. Their donation was made possible through planned giving. Planned gifts are an option for donors at all levels and include bequests, annuities, charitable Remainder Trusts and Unitrusts, life Insurance, and appreciated Securities and Real Estate. By making a planned gift, you automatically join Vesterheim’s Valhalla Society.

Mar’s unique insight into the needs of an organization and his willingness to work toward the long-term stability of Vesterheim merged to construct a place to create the museum’s “Vesterheim” magazine and many other informative and high-quality publications.

The Wrolstads don’t view their actions as exceptional. “It’s very simple to do—I really think everyone should belong to the Valhalla Society in one way or another,” said Mar. “There are just so many possibilities for giving,” he said. Vesterheim is grateful for Mar and June’s generosity.
