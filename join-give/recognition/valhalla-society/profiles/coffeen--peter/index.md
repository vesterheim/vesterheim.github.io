As a child growing up in Decorah, it wasn't hard for Peter Coffeen to be enthralled by all that Vesterheim had to offer.  “A curious child growing up in Decorah could not miss the split-log cabins on the Luther College campus and the dusty curiosities in what was then simply known as ‘the Museum’; the immigrant sail boat, old flint-lock pistols, a very strange statue with naked men fighting a big snake; wandering about at will with no security, just trust. Watching changes from then to now has been like watching an old friend grow older and better. That’s what is special,” said Peter when speaking of his personal connection to Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum.

Peter has made a successful life for himself as an actor, narrator of educational and industrial films, and even photographer. His work as an actor led him to a voice-over role in the 1992 TV movie Lincoln. Coffeen’s photography work includes fine art, still life, design in nature, flowers, and tarnished materials. Peter was an early collector of antique fine art photography, including some with scenes of life and landscape in Norway in the early twentieth century, which he donated to Vesterheim.

Though he moved away from Decorah to pursue his career, Peter always hoped one day to give back to the community that gave him so much. Peter’s previous experience working with the Museum of American Folk Art in New York ensured his decision to give back to Vesterheim. “…I was a Friend of Marion Nelson and worked closely with him . . . on the opening at the Museum of American Folk Art of the exhibition, Norwegian Folk Art: The Migration of a Tradition.” His gift to Vesterheim is a charitable bequest that will further the ongoing existence of the museum.

“I hope the fortunate among us will continue to support those people, places, and things which are valuable, meaningful and dear to them. Times are tough…it’s very personal.” Like his support of Vesterheim, Peter’s words are very heartfelt and frank when he speaks of why it is important to make a charitable gift.
