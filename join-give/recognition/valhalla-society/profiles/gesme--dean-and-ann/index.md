Dean and Ann Gesme grew up knowing what it meant to have Norwegian heritage. Ann was raised in Dane County, Wisconsin, and Dean in Winnebago County, Iowa, where they were shaped by their Norwegian families. They continued to cultivate their heritage by attending colleges with Scandinavian roots. Ann attended St. Olaf (’49) and Dean went to Luther (’51). During their first year of marriage Dean and Ann lived in Decorah, where Ann worked at Luther. This was not the couple’s first experience with Decorah and its Norwegian influence. They often visited Decorah before they were married because Ann had family living in Decorah and Dean came for family reunions.

As the family historian, Ann has written and published four books about family histories, as well as _Between Rocks and Hard Places_, which tells about life in Norway during the early and mid nineteenth century. “She gives a good picture of the houses they lived in, the kind of education they got, and how they got around,” says a reviewer of her book, Lee Rokke.

The Gesmes became members of Vesterheim in 1978 and started making contributions to ensure that Vesterheim would remain a place that cultivated Norwegian heritage. Ann became a board member in 1986 and served proudly for 18 years. Dean served as a trustee for 6 years starting in 1998. In 1990 the Gesmes made the decision to become members of the Valhalla Society. Their decision was based on accumulated interest and experience with Vesterheim over the years. In May of 1997 the Gesmes went above and beyond by establishing a pooled income fund, which is a form of planned giving that provides dividends for both the Gesmes and Vesterheim. 

The Gesmes hope that through their planned giving Vesterheim will continue their mission of preserving Norwegian heritage and connecting us all. Investing time and financial resources to preserve Norwegian heritage, culture, and folk arts is what has given the Gesmes the most satisfaction over the years.
