The inspiration to become involved with Vesterheim can come from many different areas. For Phil and Audrey Dybdahl, Vesterheim’s mission resonated deeply with them and called them to action: “Vesterheim embodies the living heritage of Norwegian immigrants to America. Sharing this cultural legacy can inspire people of all backgrounds to celebrate tradition.”

Phil and Audrey have been involved with Vesterheim for over 25 years, thanks in large part to Phil’s cousins, Anne Urness Gesme and Dean Gesme, who played a key role in starting the Dybdahls’ relationship with the museum. During these 25 years, the Dybdahls have done a little bit of everything, including both serving on Vesterheim’s Board and hosting numerous events. There was also Phil’s tireless work as a Norwegian musical performer with Dave Nelson under the pseudonym “Ole and Sven.”

Is there anything this couple hasn’t done for Vesterheim? If there is, the Dybdahls hope that their participation in the Valhalla Society will help support any needs Vesterheim might face in the future. Phil and Audrey joined the Valhalla Society approximately 20 years ago because they knew then that Vesterheim was important and needed to be provided for in the future. “We have such an appreciation for those who started Vesterheim and because we agree with the mission so strongly we want to support Vesterheim’s future through our planned gift,” Audrey says. The Valhalla Society is simply the best way to preserve the Vesterheim experience for future generations.

“While we love the entire museum, the decorative arts of Norway that can be seen throughout the museum have always held a special place in our hearts. We know that, through these artifacts, we can help to preserve and pass on our Norwegian culture.” The Dybdahls know that every employee, member, and visitor finds their own unique inspiration in the museum. What is the Dybdahls’ request to everyone considering making a planned gift? “Please support the mission and future of the museum; it is important to all of us.” 

Through Phil and Audrey’s efforts, Vesterheim has become a successful home for Norwegian artifacts, traditions, exhibits, folk-art classes, youth education, and much more. You can also support and further Vesterheim’s mission by joining the Dybdahls and providing for future generations of Vesterheim visitors.
