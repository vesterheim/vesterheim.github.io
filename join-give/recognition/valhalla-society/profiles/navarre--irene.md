It was a dark and stormy night in downtown Decorah when Irene Navarre first set foot in Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum. People told her the weather was too harsh to leave Decorah to attend a family reunion in Sacred Heart, Minnesota. Irene went to visit the museum, instead, and told her story of being stuck in town to the employee at the front desk. The employee said that he was supposed to attend the reunion in Sacred Heart, as well. It turned out that man was Irene’s third cousin and that night was the beginning of her many wonderful experiences with Vesterheim.

Irene was excited about getting involved with Vesterheim because of her Norwegian heritage. She is seven-eighths Norwegian and one-eighth Irish. Her great-grandparents were all early pioneers, who came from their home countries and settled in the Midwest. Her Irish great-grandfather immigrated in 1820 and her seven other great-grandparents emigrated from Norway between 1850 and 1861. Irene was born on August 2, 1917. Through childhood her parents stressed the importance of education. She was heavily influenced by her grandmother, who read and spoke in their native languages. 

After graduating from high school, Irene went to the University of Minnesota to study dental hygiene. The university was one of the best dental schools in the United States and provided Irene with many connections, opportunities, and experiences. Following in her great-grandparents’ footsteps, Irene was also a pioneer. In 1965 she became president of the American Dental Hygienists Association, where she emphasized public relations and professionalism in teaching. She married Harry Navarre who was a dentist and shared her love of dentistry and travel.  Irene and Harry traveled everywhere in the world, including China, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, the Caribbean, and of course, Norway.

Irene has established contact with all of her relatives in Ireland and Norway. She has visited Norway seven times and Ireland five times has an active relationship with her cousins who still live there. She traced her roots back to three places in Norway—Sigdalslag, Ringerike, and Hadeland. One year, Irene had a family reunion in Norway and 87 people from the Sigdal area came. They took an immigrant train together and visited stave churches. People who lived on the farms in the area were descendants of Irene’s ancestors.

Thanks to Irene’s interest in her heritage, she was able to attend an event at the international school in New Mexico with the Prince of Wales as the special guest. Irene and the other guests were encouraged to wear their traditional costumes, so Irene wore her Norwegian bunad. During the event she heard a voice over her shoulder saying “Good evening, Ms. Norway.” She turned around to see who it was, and it was Cary Grant, who recognized her national costume. Her passion for heritage also provided Irene with an opportunity to have dinner with King Olav of Norway in Dallas, Texas. He was in Texas to honor the early Norwegian settlements. Additionally, she had the honor of dining with King Harald and his wife in Decorah at Vesterheim.

Irene became a member of Vesterheim and eventually a consultant to the governance committee, as well as a trustee. She was a parliamentarian and revised the bylaws for the museum. Irene believes that Vesterheim is a solid base for cultural appreciation. She strongly believes that if you don’t know where you came from, you don’t know where you’re going. Irene is passionate about Vesterheim because of its careful preservation of art, language, and food, all of which are meaningful to Norwegians.

Irene decided to be a part of the Valhalla Society to strengthen her wish that the museum continue for years to come. She has always been a supportive member of Vesterheim and believes that because she is seven-eighths Norwegian, it is necessary to be a part of Valhalla. Irene said that she will donate money to Vesterheim through Valhalla. She hopes it will help Vesterheim to keep going, encourage younger generations to be loyal, and encourage others to know their culture and love their own heritage. Irene’s message to those considering being a Valhalla member is, “If you give to the museum, there is a great reward, not only for Vesterheim but for yourself too!”

A poem, often recited by Irene at speaking engagements, reminds us all to consider our own legacy: “If I have strength, I owe the service of the strong. If melody I have, I owe the world a song. If I can stand, when all around me hosts are falling. If I can run with speed, when needy hearts are calling. If my torch can light the dark of any night. Then I must pay the debt I owe with living light."
