What does Vesterheim mean to 94-year-old Decorah native, Phyllis Leseth? “It has been a wonderful part of my life. I enjoyed my time there so much,” she says. Phyllis, born in 1917, has always been deeply involved with local community and social goodwill. This, she states, resulted from her parents influence at a young age. “My family was always involved in the community and my mother did many things to help others in Decorah,” she remembers. 

So, while still young, Phyllis became involved with Vesterheim. “I was a guide at the museum,” she says, “second floor was where I gave tours.” As she recalls the various woodcarvings, dresses, and other craftwork located on the second floor, she is reminded of how much learning and education Vesterheim provides. She says, “Now that I think back, I really did learn so much giving tours—every artifact tells a different story.” Her favorite tours were those that included visitors from out of town and those with children and parents. “I loved giving tours to children. Just knowing that I was opening their eyes to a larger world was such a wonderful experience,” she recounts.

In 1966 Phyllis helped found Decorah’s Nordic Fest celebration and remained involved for many years. She went on to become the editor of the museum newsletter for 10 years until 1977.  All of these experiences led Phyllis to join the Valhalla Society, Vesterheim’s planned giving organization, in 2002.

“My desire to give back to the community was the main reason I joined the Valhalla Society,” she explains. Her joining of the Valhalla Society comes after a lifetime of giving to the museum. “It’s a great way to be able to provide for the museum even after I’m gone.” In addition to providing tours, Phyllis served on Vesterheim’s Board of Trustees for 28 years and has helped to guide Vesterheim to where it is today.

Phyllis encourages others to join the Valhalla Society, and believes it’s important to recognize how fortunate Decorah is to have a museum like Vesterheim within their community. She says, “Vesterheim is a wonderful place and provides so many educational opportunities for children and adults alike. I want Vesterheim to continue to be a presence in this community for future generations. I hope through my gift I can help to achieve that.” While Phyllis is no longer able to spend as much time assisting the museum, she knows she’s lived a very blessed life. “I am so lucky,” she says. “I have been able to do so much for the museum and they have done so much in return for, not only Decorah, but the greater Norwegian community.”
