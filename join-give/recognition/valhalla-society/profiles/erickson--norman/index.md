Norman E. Erickson, formerly of Cedar Rapids, was a supportive member of Vesterheim,illustrated by a charitable bequest and other gifts dating back to his first $5 contribution in 1966. Norman passed away in September 2010, but his legacy is very much alive at Vesterheim. He lives on in the smiles of visitors to the museum each year and in the hearts and minds of those working to preserve a heritage and connect us all.

Norman E. Erickson was born in Postville, Iowa, in April 1920. He grew up during the Great Depression in nearby Clermont, where he spent his summer days fossil hunting throughout Fayette County and fishing the Turkey and Mississippi Rivers with his father. He graduated from Clermont High School in 1937 and attended Coe College in Cedar Rapids, graduating in 1941.

Just out of college, Norman went to work for the Iowa Electric Light and Power in the accounting department, where he worked until his retirement in 1984, with the exception of the time he proudly served in the Navy during WWII (1943 - 1946). He took full advantage of all the benefits offered to him by his employer and submitted copies of all his charitable contributions to their matching gifts program. In this way, he was able to double each gift he made to Vesterheim.

In 1951, Norman married Floy LaVerle (Morgan) Erickson in Cedar Rapids. Together, Norman and Floy were very active in many local organizations and supported their community in many ways, but their true passions were spending time with family and traveling. With family and friends, they enjoyed numerous trips and traveled to all 48 states in the continental United States, and to Alaska, England, and Norway, where they visited family in Oslo.

Norman and Floy were devoted to their heritage. Through his membership in the Valhalla Society, Norman recognized that a bequest is a simple, easy, and effective means for donors to leave a legacy and make a difference in the lives of others for generations to come.
