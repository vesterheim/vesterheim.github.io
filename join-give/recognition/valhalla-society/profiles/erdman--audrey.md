Audrey Erdman perfectly exemplified a Scandinavian Midwestern woman. She valued her Norwegian culture, enjoyed travel and adventure, loved her family and friends, and of course always had lefse on the holidays. These things that defined Audrey are what led her to become an essential part of Vesterheim’s family.

Audrey grew up in southern Minnesota, in the city of Slayton. After high school she left Slayton for Northfield, Minnesota, to pursue a degree in economics from St. Olaf College. With the ambition of a fresh graduate she began a career teaching business education at various high schools in Minnesota. While she taught, she continued her education through a summer Master’s degree program at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Soon after, she accepted a teaching position in the business department at Luther College. It was at Luther where Audrey met Lowell Erdman and the two were married soon after. To spend more time with Lowell, Audrey quit teaching and became a bookkeeper for her husband’s business Erdman Engineering.

While keeping books for the family business and raising a family she still made time for numerous activities and memberships in various organizations. These local groups kept Audrey busy and involved. The organization to which she dedicated most of her time was Vesterheim because she enjoyed the people and the cultural richness of the museum. Vesterheim was able to utilize Audrey’s talents in business and organization to the fullest.

Audrey was passionate about exploring her Norwegian and German heritage. Family genealogy was a heartfelt hobby for her and included several trips to Norway. Her keen interest in her Norwegian heritage inspired her to purchase an authentic wool bunad (a traditional Norwegian dress), which appeared frequently at many annual Nordic Fests and Vesterheim activities.

In 1976 she was elected to Vesterheim’s Board of Trustees where she continued until 2010, serving one of the longest terms as a trustee in Vesterheim’s history. She was an asset to the organization on the Audit, Personnel, and Campaign Strategic Planning Committees. Her term on the Board was highlighted by her co-chairing the committee planning the Royal Visit of King Harald V and Queen Sonja in 1995. For her work in organizing the Royal Visit she received the title of Knight of the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit. Audrey’s zeal for Vesterheim was lovingly passed on to her children as well. She told her son Lindsay “when I’m done you’ll have to be on the Board” and, indeed, he is continuing her legacy today.  

Though Audrey believed that volunteer work was crucial for the museum to flourish, she also understood the importance of providing financial support to Vesterheim. Audrey gave many donations through memorials of family and friends to make a difference at Vesterheim. She received the Bronze Kroneklubben certificate in 2002 for her generous lifetime gifts to the museum. Lindsay replied to Audrey’s giving, saying, “she had been with Vesterheim for many years and watched the changes, the growth, the opportunities, and the challenges; she knew that non-profit institutions such as Vesterheim needed support from as many different directions as possible.”  

Audrey was also a member of the Valhalla society showing her commitment to the organization and her interminable belief in its mission. Lindsay commented on his mother’s Valhalla gift saying “Her gift was not large in terms of monetary impact, but I think it represented support for Vesterheim’s mission, support for something that was important to her friends and colleagues, and support for an important element in the community.” No matter the size of a planned gift, members of the Valhalla society are crucial for the museums future and growth.  

Audrey believed “it takes a village” to support an institution like Vesterheim, a “village” that includes a contribution of talents, time, and resources. You can become a member of the Valhalla Society and help to perpetuate unique places such as Vesterheim.
