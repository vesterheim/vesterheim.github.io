Helena Naef was an active member of the Decorah community and loved donating her time to Vesterheim. Helena was born November 18, 1933, in Affoltem am Albis, Switzerland. In 1947 she emigrated with her family to the U.S. and settled in Big Pine, California.

After her high school graduation, Helena moved to San Francisco, and began working as an accountant. She met her husband, William George Naef, in 1952 while he was stationed in San Francisco for the U.S army. The couple wed on June 20, 1953, and worked in San Francisco until their move to Decorah in 1991.

The time she spent sewing, weaving, and knitting shows her love of textiles. A long time supporter of the Weaver’s Guild, she made many contributions to Vesterheim to help purchase looms and textile-related tools. Helena also contributed to the construction of the Lila Nelson Weaving Classroom in the Westby-Torgerson Education Center.

Helena generously donated to the museum the proceeds from selling her woven goods during Decorah’s Annual Nordic Fest. “She was very encouraging of other weavers and knitters,” said Vesterheim Chief Curator, Laurann Gilbertson. Laurann had the pleasure of working with Helena on several occasions. She often demonstrated her skills to others and wanted to make sure that those interested in the craft could learn some techniques. Throughout her life, Helena also enjoyed spending precious time with her husband and friends. Helena passed away on June 13, 2012, leaving a gift to Vesterheim in her will and fond memories of all that she did for the museum.
