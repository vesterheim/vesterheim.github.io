An interview with Steve Johnson and Charlie Langton
----------------------------------------

We are fortunate to share the story of two men who have generously supported Vesterheim through dedicated years of service and a planned gift.

**Tell us your Vesterheim story.**

SJ- The summer of 1969, I was assigned through Luther College’s Work Study program to work at Vesterheim Museum. I worked full time in the summers and ten to twelve hours a week during the school year until I graduated. I returned to Vesterheim in 1979 and worked as the curator for the Jacobson Farmstead.

CL- While Steve was working as the curator at the museum’s Jacobson Farmstead, we were hired to do a historical survey for the Allamakee County Historical Society. I told him that I was looking for a job.
SJ- I told Charlie to talk to Marion Nelson, the Executive Director of Vesterheim at that time, and his wife, Lila, and see if they had work or a position for him.

CL- In 1986 I got the position as Editor and Archivist.

**How has Vesterheim changed since then?**

CL- Before I began working at Vesterheim, the museum rarely did press releases. They had an archive room with unorganized boxes. The archives are now completely organized with hired staff to keep it up to date. Publications has been completely transformed, with computers, color printing, a website, email newsletter, magazine and more.

SJ- While Charlie was busy establishing the Publications Department, I was working in different departments of the museum, serving in different capacities. I have worked as the Associate Director of Development, Internal Auditor, Director of Development, Director of Historic Preservation and Facilities, Deputy Director, and Executive Director. From those positions I was able to see the museum grow by adding professional staff, expanding the collections, and enlarging the museum campus. This all happened through increased funding which created new opportunities for programming, events, exhibitions, educational activities, and more.

**What makes Vesterheim special to you?**

SJ- The devotion to the institution of my mentors Dr. Marion and Lila Nelson and having artifacts in the collection from my ancestors. I also find it very special to meet with individuals with the common goals of preserving heritage and individuals who care for the well-being of the institution.

CL- The museum is special because of the connections we offer people to their heritage. Vesterheim is about people. If the museum was merely about the objects, it would be nothing. But the museum is about the people who find value in the objects that make it truly special.

**What is it like working for a non-profit and seeing the effects planned giving has on a company?**

CL- Almost every year a planned gift comes in and allows us to keep the doors open and do exciting things that we wouldn’t be able to do without them. Nonprofits receive less and less support from the government, and securing foundation support is increasingly more difficult, so planned giving is the blood that provides life to nonprofit organizations like Vesterheim. 

SJ- Through working in my various positions at Vesterheim I was able to meet many of the people who are in the Valhalla Society. These people create an extended family atmosphere for the museum because they care so deeply for enhancing the museum campus and care about the staff.
What caused you to join Valhalla?

CL- I’m Irish. Irish Americans do not have a strong material culture; most of their tradition is passed down through stories and music, not things. So it amazed me to see the Norwegians’ passion for preserving their objects and traditions. A Vesterheim tour to Ireland and Norway allowed me to completely understand this attachment people have with their heritage and the graphic connection they have to culture, because it helped me connect to mine. I joined the Valhalla Society to help prevent the loss of Nordic material culture and traditions and preserve this irreplaceable asset for the future.

**Why should staff and board members become a part of the Valhalla Society when they are already giving so much to Vesterheim?**

SJ- I chose to be in the Valhalla Society because that particular program is critical and significant for the museum’s future. Becoming a member is one of the most meaningful ways for people to express their support for the preservation of the things we hold dear and want to share with future generations.

CL- If board members and staff cannot invest in museum’s the future, then what hope can the museum have that others will? Staff and board members need to be leaders! Joining the Valhalla Society is painless. It doesn’t take a cent out of your pocket and never will. Planned giving is an arrangement for benefits, so gifts through your name don’t have to see the light of day until you pass.

**What would you tell our members, staff, board members, and donors to encourage them to make a gift like yours?**

SJ- An enduring and timeless gift that supports the Annual Fund is critical. Joining the Valhalla Society helps build our general endowment, providing much-needed revenue for maintenance and relieving staff from spending time finding funds to balance the budget. It allows staff to devote their time in other areas to enhance the museum, activities, events and other needs.

CL- I would tell them that joining the Valhalla Society is a way of keeping alive a culture, a tradition—a vital cultural tradition— and do it painlessly. There is no financial sacrifice given during your lifetime, it is all about what happens after you have passed. This creates an easy way to help preserve a heritage and culture without hardship. So the real question is not “Why?” but “Why not?”
