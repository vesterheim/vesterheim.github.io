Berit T. Mesarick emigrated from Norway to America with her husband, John, in 1967. They settled in Williamsburg, Virginia, but spent time traveling the United States, seeking connections to their homeland. Upon her first visit to Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum in 1982, she was immediately enthralled by all of the Norwegian ancestry surrounding her. “I found Vesterheim to be a piece of Norway here in America, an important reminder of my country of birth and upbringing,” said Berit, when speaking of the museum. She was especially impressed by Vesterheim’s preservation of folk art, textiles, and furniture and has graciously donated to Vesterheim’s Annual Fund.

Berit, who is from Oslo, Norway, worked at the American Embassy in Oslo for a number of years. Her husband was an American who had been working in Norway for ten years when they met while skiing in the mountains. Berit and John were married for 35 years.

After the passing of her beloved husband in 1992, Berit made the decision to join Vesterheim’s Valhalla Society by putting a bequest in her will. “I hope my gift to Vesterheim will help to maintain its work in the future,” Berit said. Berit also hopes to encourage others to join The Valhalla Society and help preserve Norwegian heritage in America for future generations to come.
