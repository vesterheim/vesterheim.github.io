Founded in 1989, the Valhalla Society consists of a special group of donors who have chosen to honor their passion for preservation with planned giving. Their gifts provide a lasting legacy for the future of Vesterheim. 

There is no planned gift minimum for the Valhalla Society. By including the museum in your estate plans and notifying Vesterheim of your plan you will be honored as a member of the Valhalla Society. If you have already established a planned gift that includes Vesterheim, please let us know by contacting Steve Grinna at 563-382-9681, ext. 109, or sgrinna@vesterheim.org. Once Vesterheim is informed of your plans, you will become a member of the Valhalla Society. 

Learn more here about different types of planned giving and how you can leave a substantial legacy with minimum impact to your income or your estate. Your gift will help secure the best of the past for future generations.
