Planned gifts are instrumental in helping us achieve our goals of providing the highest quality of care to the collection, and preserve and interpret our immigrant heritage for all.

Everyone who makes a planned gift to Vesterheim and informed Vesterheim of this gift can become a member of the museum's Valhalla Society. Founded in 1989, the Valhalla Society consists of a special group of donors who have chosen to honor their passion for preservation with planned giving. These gifts provide a lasting legacy for the future of Vesterheim.

* Retirement Assets, Life Insurance, and Real Estate: Retirement, life insurance, and real estate assets may all be donated to Vesterheim.

How Do I Establish a Planned Gift?
----------------------------------
One of the most common forms of planned gifting is a will or trust bequest. To gift using a bequest is as simple as inserting a few sentences in your will. For example, “I give ($ amount) to Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum.”

There are also ways you can make a significant future gift while retaining the income you receive from the asset used to make the gift. Two common examples of these types of gifts are: Retained Life Estate and Charitable Remainder Trusts.
