  teaser: Join the Valhalla Society. Including Vesterheim in your estate plans can be a great way to benefit the museum and leave a lasting legacy.

Planned gifts are instrumental in helping Vesterheim maintain the activities and programs so essential to our members and visitors. These gifts provide a lasting legacy for the future of Vesterheim. Including Vesterheim in your estate plans can be a great way to benefit the museum, while meeting your current income needs and providing for future heirs.

How Do I Establish a Planned Gift?
----------------------------------
One of the most common forms of planned gifting is a will or trust bequest. To gift using a bequest is as simple as inserting a few sentences in your will. For example, “I give ($ amount) to Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum.” 

There are also ways you can make a significant future gift while retaining the income you receive from the asset used to make the gift. Two common examples of these types of gifts are: Retained Life Estate and Charitable Remainder Trusts.

For details on how to set up planned giving, please contact Steve Grinna at 563-382-9681, ext. 109, or email at [sgrinna@vesterheim.org](mailto:sgrinna@vesterheim.org). Restrictions apply, so consult with your financial adviser to determine how such a gift would affect your overall tax and estate planning, as well as the rules pertaining to your state of residence.
