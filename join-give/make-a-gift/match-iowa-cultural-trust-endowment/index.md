The endowment supports annual operating expenses. The challenge takes place over a two-year period, is a 3:1 match (Vesterheim will receive $1 for every $3 raised as part of the challenge) and ends December 31, 2016.

Here are all of the ways you can contribute! **Make sure to specify Iowa Endowment Challenge Grant with your gift!**
