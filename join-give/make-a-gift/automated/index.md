Join Vesterheim’s Compass Club!
-------------------------------
Compass Club members make donations through automatic monthly deductions from checking or savings accounts. Automatic payments are safe, convenient, and tax-deductible. They can be easily monitored through your regular bank statement, and, as a rule, Compass Club members don’t receive additional Annual Fund solicitations during the year!

The consistency of automated donations helps Vesterheim:

* house, care for, and interpret the artifacts that are central to its mission.
* offer quality folk-art and youth programming.
* create exciting events.
* mount new exhibitions, some of which travel throughout the country.

When the cost of these vital core activities is secured, Vesterheim is better able to sail fearlessly toward new horizons.

By becoming a Vesterheim Compass Club member, you receive special recognition and a host of benefits, including:

* easy automatic tax-deductible donations.
* a Family Membership to the museum, which includes the full-color magazine Vesterheim, catalogs, and regular discounts on classes and purchases.
* recognition in Vesterheim’s _Annual Report_.
* 10 guest passes.
* one scheduled “Behind the Scenes” tour each year.
* invitations to Vesterheim receptions, where you can meet other Compass Club members.
* the option of receiving e-mail updates on museum exhibitions, activities, and plans for the future.
