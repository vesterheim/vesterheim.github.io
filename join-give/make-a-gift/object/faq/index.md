Does Vesterheim provide appraisals?
-----------------------------------
Vesterheim does not provide appraisals for any reason because the Internal Revenue Service regards museums and libraries as interested parties. Donors should seek a professional appraiser before making their donation. To find a licensed appraiser, contact the American Society of Appraisers, the International Society of Appraisers, or the Appraisers Association of America. Please note professional appraisers perform services for a fee.

Can I receive a tax deduction for my donation?
----------------------------------------------
All donations accepted by Vesterheim Museum are considered charitable contributions to a not-for-profit organization. Please consult with your accountant or tax preparer.

How are potential donations received?
-------------------------------------
In advance of your visit, please contact Vesterheim and tell collections staff about the items you wish to donate. Next, collections staff will help you fill out a Temporary Custody Receipt at the time of the donation. This receipt lists your contact information, the items and their history, and your wishes for the items if they are not accepted for the collection. Your signature on this receipt gives Vesterheim permission to evaluate the donated items for the collection.  Ownership is not transferred at this time. All donations for the collection are reviewed by a committee using the museum’s specific collecting criteria to determine if the items are appropriate for the collection. All items that are accepted for the collection are listed in a letter of acceptance and/or deed of gift, which officially transfers ownership of the items to Vesterheim Museum. This process can take from one to three months.

Does Vesterheim Museum accept long-term loans?
----------------------------------------------
Vesterheim Museum does not accept long-term loans unless an item is required for an exhibition because of insurance and liability issues, as well as storage constraints.

Does it cost anything to donate materials to Vesterheim Museum?
---------------------------------------------------------------
There is no fee to donate artifacts; however, there are many ongoing costs associated with the preservation and care of the collection. These include:  professional staff, climate control, archival storage supplies, insurance, conservation, equipment, collections database. You can support your donation by becoming a Vesterheim member and by making a donation to the care of the collections. Learn about opportunities for donating to Vesterheim here. Donate today here.

Does Vesterheim Museum purchase items for the collection?
---------------------------------------------------------
Vesterheim Museum rarely purchases items for the collection. Purchased items still must meet the same criteria as donated items.

Does Vesterheim Museum return donated items?
--------------------------------------------
After something is accessioned and a part of Vesterheim’s collection, it cannot be returned to the donor. Your acceptance letter and deed of gift form legally transfers ownership of donated items to Vesterheim Museum.
