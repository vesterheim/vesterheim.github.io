You can as much as triple your gift to Vesterheim if you or your spouse works for a company that will match your personal contribution through an employee/retiree matching gift program! Many corporations provide matching gift programs in recognition of an employee’s or other eligible individual’s support of his or her favorite charity. Matching gifts are usually equal to a donor’s gifts, although some corporations match on a two-to-one or greater ratio. Ask your Human Resources Department to see if your company will help us make your dollars stretch even further.
