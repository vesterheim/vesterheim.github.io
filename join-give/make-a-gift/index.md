Many corporations provide matching gift programs in recognition of an employee’s or other eligible individual’s support of his or her favorite charity. Matching gifts are usually equal to a donor’s gifts, although some corporations match on a two-to-one or greater ratio. Ask your Human Resources Department to see if your company will help us make your dollars stretch even further.
