The 2014 Folk Art Benefit Auction, which ran through the month of October, was completely online at Bidding For Good, and it was a great success. We want to thank all of the bidders and especially the folk artists for donating such wonderful and sought-after pieces!

This auction provided people from all over the country with the chance to bid on items they love. We were excited and proud that pieces by these folk artists received worldwide exposure and were bid on by folk-art fans far and wide. Winning bidders came from California, Nevada, Utah, New Jersey, Connecticut, New York, North Dakota, and Kansas, just to name a few. During the auction, there were 739 separate bids on the 67 items.

The auction is one of our biggest fundraising events. All proceeds go to projects directly related to Vesterheim’s Folk Art School. Proceeds this year totaled $23,086.

Check the final bids here.
