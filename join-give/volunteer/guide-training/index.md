Guide training week is designed to provide background and support to Vesterheim’s guides in a concentrated format twice a year. Volunteers who have indicated an interest in becoming tour guides automatically receive the guide training schedules in the spring and fall. Guide training is scheduled around other activities at Vesterheim and varies in both content and timing.

The overall goal of guide training is to provide information on Norwegian-American history and Vesterheim’s exhibitions and collections, along with safety and security training, and encouragement in the art of leading tours for the museum’s visitors. If you are interested in volunteering as a tour guide, please contact Martha Griesheimer at [mgriesheimer@vesterheim.org](mailto:mgriesheimer@vesterheim.org), or 563-382-9681.
