Many of the volunteer opportunities at Vesterheim are outlined on our Volunteer Questionnaire. Filling out this questionnaire and returning it to Martha Griesheimer at Vesterheim, P.O. Box 379, Decorah, IA 52101, or mgriesheimer@vesterheim.org is the first step in becoming involved. With your preferences in hand, Martha can contact you when opportunities arise that match your range of interests.
