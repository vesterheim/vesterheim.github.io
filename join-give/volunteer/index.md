Volunteers of all ages and abilities are involved at Vesterheim, and new volunteers are always welcome. There are great opportunities for people of many walks of life. You may be able to offer a specific skill or talent, but often, enthusiasm and a willingness to learn are the only requirement for a volunteer task!

You will find a comprehensive list of volunteer skill requests here. Our volunteers are tour guides and folk artists, cooks and servers, clerical and curatorial helpers, translators and teachers, carpenters and painters, and more. Most importantly, each volunteer is an ambassador for Vesterheim.

The time commitment to volunteer varies a lot. Some people volunteer weekly, while others help out for a few hours occasionally, or even just once a year. In a typical year, there are about 300 active volunteers who give over 3,000 hours of volunteer time.

Vesterheim holds infinite potential for exploration and lifelong learning. Volunteering can be a great experience that evolves over time. The important thing is to get started! If you are interested in getting involved as a volunteer, download this volunteer questionnaire and return it to Martha Griesheimer, coordinator of volunteers, at Vesterheim, P.O. Box 379, Decorah, IA 52101, or mgriesheimer@vesterheim.org.

Martha says, “the best part of my job is working with volunteers to match them with tasks they will enjoy.”
