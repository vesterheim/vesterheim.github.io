**You could own this beautiful _skinnfell!_** 

Vesterheim is extremely pleased to announce the raffle of a _skinnfell_ made by Norwegian artist Britt Solheim during a class she taught at Vesterheim. _Skinnfellen_ are traditional Norwegian bed coverings made from sheep skins sewn together. In the ancient craft of _skinnfellsøm,_ Scandinavians use wood blocks and alder-bark dye to decorate the suede side of the skin with symbols that represent prayers for protection, good harvests, health, love, and fertility. _Skinnfellen_ are highly valued for their beauty and warmth. This piece is roughly 2 feet 10.5 inches by 3 feet 5 inches.
