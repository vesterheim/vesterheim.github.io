What is the Annual Fund?
------------------------
The Annual Fund is what allows Vesterheim to open its doors to visitors, turn on the lights, care for its extensive collection, offer exhibitions, events, and educational programs, to name but a few things. Annually, it costs nearly $2 million to operate the museum. Some of this expense is defrayed by income from admissions, events, membership, store sales, class tuition, and tours, but like most museums, Vesterheim depends on contributions to the Annual Fund. Your contribution to this fund goes to work immediately to keep Vesterheim vital for generations to come and allows this institution to carry out its mission each and every day.

The Annual Fund supports everything that informs and delights visitors about Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum. Everything we do, every day, depends in large part on Annual Fund giving. Thanks to you and people like you who give to Vesterheim’s Annual Fund, we are able to offer the world class exhibits, programs, and publications to which you have become accustomed.
