What is the Annual Fund?
------------------------
The Annual Fund allows Vesterheim to open its doors to visitors; turn on the lights; care for its extensive collection; offer exhibitions, events, and educational programs; perform research; and serve both members and visitors throughout the world. Annually, it costs nearly $2 million to operate the museum. Some of this expense is defrayed by income from admissions, events, membership, store sales, class tuition, and tours, but as with most museums, contributions to Vesterhemi's Annual Fund is absolutely crucial. Your contribution to this fund goes to work immediately to keep Vesterheim vital for generations to come and allows this institution to carry out its mission each and every day.

Thanks to you and people like you who give to Vesterheim’s Annual Fund, we are able to offer the world class exhibits, programs, and publications to which you have become accustomed.
