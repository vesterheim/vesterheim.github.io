Why Join?

{: .heading--large }

Vesterheim is the most comprehensive museum in the United States dedicated to a single immigrant group. The museum occupies most of a square block in downtown Decorah with an Open Air Division of 12 historic buildings. But Vesterheim is more than a world-class museum preserving artifacts of the past. It is a cultural center dedicated to preserving living traditions by offering special exhibitions, events, classes in Norwegian folk art and culture, and special programs for pre-school, elementary, secondary and college students throughout the year.

To accomplish all this, and so much more, Vesterheim depends upon the support of its local, regional, and national corporate members.

Your corporate membership recognizes Vesterheim’s contribution to regional economic impact and, at the same time, supports Vesterheim’s outreach through its publications and events to an impressive membership across the nation. Your corporate philanthropy builds and serves a new audience while fulfilling your company’s community service goals.

Vesterheim is a proud partner in the Decorah community. We are pleased to join forces with our Corporate Members to bring people to our area, including:

* 13,000 museum visitors each year from all 50 states and more than 30 foreign countries.
* 2,600 college and school-aged children visit each year as part of their curriculum.
* 300 students participate annually in classes in traditional folk art and culture.
* The best folk artists from all over America and Norway come to Vesterheim to teach classes.
* Special dignitaries like the Norwegian Honorary Consul General and members of the Norwegian Royal Family visit on a regular basis.

Additionally, Vesterheim is active in the Decorah area through:

* The Decorah Area Chamber of Commerce
