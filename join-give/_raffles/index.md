**You could own a Sigmaling!** 

Vesterheim is extremely pleased to announce the raffle of a framed “Sigmaling” panel by Sigmund Aarseth. The piece is roughly 2 feet 6.5 inches by 4 feet 3.5 inches and is painted in rich olive greens with wine red.

**Raffle tickets are $2.50 each!**

The drawing will be held during Decorah's Nordic Fest on Saturday, July 26, at 3:00 p.m. 

You need not be present to win. Proceeds benefit Vesterheim.

The panel was donated by the artist with framing donated by The Perfect Edge in Decorah, Iowa.
